"
2838,-1,"I'd be like, well, I ain't got nobody else play play with y'all.

2854,-1,"Um, I didn't quite no what my path was gonna be other than that I'm'a just get my education and see where it takes me.
"
2855,-1,"So, they're like, we need someone who can talk to the families and just be mundane.
"
2858,-1,"We won't- we won't be that, so you're good.

"
2862,-1,"I was like, I am moving, I can't be here, this is- I'm going to commit a crime, and I don't wanna commit a crime  cause I don't want my kids in these schools.

"
2866,-1,"I can't tell them about the museums and the- the other exhibits and things when I should be able to, you know.
"
2867,-1,"Never felt like it then I just wanted to be like, I hope they got insurance, but I never felt like it then.
"

"
2871,-1,"Um, so we would be like, Mr. Michaelyn, there's nothing we can do with them.
"
2872,-1,"And he would just be so upset, but he knew that it was- it was nothing you could really do.
"
2873,-1,"So then it would be my job to talk to the families.
"
2874,-1,"And, um, obviously they know what happened already, but to let them know that we're not gonna be able to have open casket, do you have a picture?
"
2875,-1,"First of all, I can only listen to go go music for five minutes, and that's how long the song should be.
"
2876,-1,"Okay, I would be like, I'm tired.
"
2877,-1,"And, um,  it was another song, but they went on to be with Salt-n-Pepa.
"
2879,-1,"Oh my gosh, so now mumbo sauce, it used to be just a DC thing, but Chicago will argue.
"
2880,-1,"But it used to be just a DC thing.

2881,-1,"if you're going down- if you gonna go to, um, the wharf for example, where it used to be Phillips,  you- you can go that way to get there.
"
2882,-1,"Like those the- they're not like- you can like, pay them, you know, to be like, let me pay these people for their- for their property, cause that's what they usually do with the houses, but.
"
2883,-1,"And, you know, cause they have to, cause you got people paying to be here.
"
2884,-1,"It wasn't like-  it wasn't controlling environments where a kid can really be a kid, basically.
"
2885,-1,"I would be one of those people that would purchase like, at the Ritz Georgetown, or something like that.
"
2886,-1,"Cause it's like you put these- you build up these nice rich neighborhood with these affluent people are gonna be there but you- you leave the surrounding areas the same and then take their jobs.
"
2887,-1,"I'd rather be in a place where everybody is pretty much Mm.
"
2888,-1,"Some of the classes think that only a particular race can be one thing and vice versa.
"
2889,-1,"It's like, I wouldn't be considered dark in DR.
"
2890,-1,"You would be borderline.
"
2891,-1,"Now that could be a good and a bad thing.
"
2892,-1,"Um, you know, amidst of having fun we would um, also have to avoid certain things in the a- in the streets that we knew we weren't supposed to be involved in.
"
2893,-1,"Um, I didn't know later I would be a pastor or you know, a rapper, you know.
"
2895,-1,"I grew up listening to it but I never thought I would be rapping.
"
2896,-1,"Or Pharaoh tried to kill Moses, all the babies, so Moses wouldn't come, and then the King tried to kill Jesus, p- so Jesus wouldn't become and be the Messiah.
"
2897,-1,"what- who I was and didn't know exactly where I was going and who I was gonna be.
"
2898,-1,"Thank you God for keeping me from killing myself, but I won't be punked again, homie.
"
2899,-1,"Now I don't need you cause I'm not gonna be vulnerable anymore.
"
2900,-1,"One of my- One of my friends Tyke- I wanted to be just like Tyke.
"
2901,-1,"I'd be like, come on pastor, give me some good stuff cause I gotta have five days of material now.
"
2902,-1,"I thought I was gonna be a cartoon animator and a comic book artist cause that's you know- I love drawing, and I do voi- voices and impersonations.
"
2903,-1,"So I thought I would be a voice over artist and a uh, visual artist, a comic book artist.
"
2904,-1,"I didn't like to play sports but I- I like to be creative and draw and write.
"
2905,-1,"to be the Youth um- a Youth Discipleship Director.
"
2906,-1,"So from two thousand eight to two thousand thirteen I moved from Forestville, and I was living in Upper Marlboro briefly um, cause I didn't wanna be anywhere near DC.
"
2907,-1,"We moved to Upper Marlboro briefly, but in Upper Marlboro from two thousand eight to two thousand thirteen, God started really moving on my heart to give me a burden for the city that I didn't wanna be in.
"
2908,-1,"And my heart got softened toward it to come and help and be a part of the solution.
"
2909,-1,"And I just- I didn't want my family around the violence that can be in the neighborhood and the trouble.
"
2910,-1,"We wanted to be right in the middle of the challenges in- in the community.
"
2911,-1,"You know, our neighborhood's not all what the media portrays it to be, but we do have some elements unfortunately of people who do things they shouldn't do.
"
2912,-1,"Um, and so God wants us right there to be a light in the midst of this- the darkness that surround us.
"
2913,-1,"Um, not to be the dun dun da dun!
"
2914,-1,"So I didn't know where we would be worshipping with Eisha, so we were just- I went to- knocked on doors.
"
2915,-1,"They got to be responsible for them if something breaks, blase blah.
"
2916,-1,"So came in, met with the interim director at the time, and uh, did a- did a walk through, prayed about it, and felt the peace of God to- hey, say, we're gonna be here.
"
2917,-1,"We wanted to be right in the midst of where um, the community is, where the people are that we wanna serve and help, so.
"
2918,-1,"That could be a Oh yeah.
"
2919,-1,"Yeah, that'd be good.
"
2920,-1,"This is the one place you can go to get go go, so when you wanna like it again, it'll be here waiting on you.
"
2921,-1,"But yeah, um, go go in of itself, it can be very misogynistic.
"
2922,-1,"It can be very explicit.
"
2923,-1,"Gotta be creative if you wanna keep attention long time, that's what I say.
"
2924,-1,"And I think the Pope, uh, somebody tweeted that the Pope will be asking for some mumbo sauce while he's here in DC.
"
2925,-1,"And that will be my lean protein with some mumbo sauce.
"
2926,-1,"I think my favorite book would have to be one of my leadership books.
"
2927,-1,"Uh, I think my favorite leadership book would have to be John Maxwell's, uh, Twenty One Irrefutable Laws of Leadership.
"
2928,-1,"to people today, what would that piece of advice be and why?
"
2929,-1,"Piece of advice I would leave to people would be Proverbs chapter three verses five and six.
"
2930,-1,"They following you know, what people around the neighborhood tell 'em they should be doing.
"
2931,-1,"So I think Proverbs chapters three verse five and six would be what I would leave.
"
2932,-1,"It- when you decide to be bad, you w- I remember one time I did get in trouble.
"
2933,-1,"Yeah, us as kids, they saw us- they'll see us, especially the ones that, you know, they knew it wasn't their lifestyle, we'll be in their area, hey y'all need to go.
"
2934,-1,"Or we shouldn't be in that area at the time.
"
2935,-1,"I- I don't- I don't think Boston is gonna be as good everybody think they are, mainly because Kyrie is a player that ha- has the w- got to have the ball, that's why he left.
"
2936,-1,"that went to other teams, so the chemistry gonna be off, I think.
"
2937,-1,"That's why I think it's gonna be a- better for the Wizards right now cause they have the same core players.
"
2938,-1,"I- man, you know,  I don't like LeBron but as long as he's playing, he's- he has to be a favorite.
"
2939,-1,"Uh, you know what the biggest difference is gonna be?
"
2940,-1,"That's why Kyrie- I mean, guess why Kyrie left, cause he wants to be the person who has the ball in his hands at all times.
"
2941,-1,"Because everybody wanted to be the guy.
"
2942,-1,"Game like that they should be dominate- And it's good that they have a bye this week all the injuries they got.
"
2943,-1,"Basketball game, I gotta be there.
"
2944,-1,"And you miss all that could be happening.
"
2945,-1,"So let's- we'll move on, so-   so tell me about- um,  So when- when the- the season really starts we will be most definitely talking about- So Jeriel and I used to talk about the games, um, after- after the games.
"
2948,-1,"But I- I don't just give her stuff just to be giving her- I mean, I explain to her, you know, why I'm doing it.
"
2949,-1,"Yeah, and that's why I talk to my daughter all the time about what's important, I mean, what's gonna be there as she get older.
"
2950,-1,"And she don't need it now, I mean, it's- it's just gonna- as long as you're living it's gonna be there.
"
2951,-1,"I'm not gonna lie I used to be.
"
2953,-1,"Every decision you make, you gotta be, how would it benefit the organization I'm working for?
"
2954,-1,"Every day, I mean, it's- and I- I didn't really see security and like hospitality like, connecting together  until I started working in the hotel world because, of course, you gotta, you know, provide a p- uh, secure presence by standing in the lobby, at the same time you gotta be hospitable, too.
"
2955,-1,"I talked to her for a while, aksed her did she need anything, I got the front desk- It might be Alece.
"
2956,-1,"I was like, well, I'll be downstairs waiting on you.
"
2957,-1,"The- Jawon the c- the circle I hung around and still hang around I really never hung around nobody that was- that I'm close to that got into like situations like that or put theirself in position to be in- in that situation.
"
2958,-1,"I mean, I'm- like I said, growing up you s- you see a lot growing up as far as   who you consider to be as trouble makers, um, part of the bad crowd.
"
2959,-1,"You don't have to be.
"
2960,-1,"People you didn't know, because if a band played on like, Benning Road, and it's a well-known band, people from- it ain't gonna just be people from Benning Road that go over there to see that band play.
"
2961,-1,"I think it's really really unique that in go go I could be in a band, your band playing, I could come on your stage with your band never miss a beat.
"
2962,-1,"Um, just- I mean, and- and you gotta figure you go to a go go, you gonna be there for a couple of hours.
"
2963,-1,"Um, and they taught us how to be counselors.
"
2964,-1,"I knew it was more, had to be more that, um-  From then on, I always took a liking to like, kids.
"
2965,-1,"I've always wanted to be in a position where I'm- I'm I guess can play a part in a child's life in any type of way.
"
2966,-1,"And, um, Miss Shaneka used to be the branch director there.
"
2967,-1,"But she used to be over at number eleven.
"
2968,-1,"Um, but yeah she used to be other there.
"
2969,-1,"Uh, it means- know, bama could be the way you dress, or you say something stupid.
"
2970,-1,"Bama used to be the way you dressed though.
"
2971,-1,"So it can be anything?
"
2972,-1,"It can be anything.
"
2973,-1,"If you had to leave a piece of advice, and you can decide who you're talking to, what would that piece of advice be?
"
2974,-1,"But as I got older I know that he meant that, um, in everything you do, be proud of it.
"
2975,-1,"But in everything you do be positive with it and have a attitude where though it's gonna get done cause I'm gonna do it.
"
2977,-1,"I just wanted it to be kind of like, sixty seven.
"
2978,-1,"And unfortunately, I think that contributed to sort of the um, neighborhood not being taken care of and- and not groomed and yards weren't done like they used to be when I was growing up.
"
2979,-1,"But during that time, it was just- It was really hard for me t- just to kind of um, be comfortable in my own skin.
"
2980,-1,"When my dad retired, there used to be a group of um,  men on the block, fathers that used to hang up- Just- just hang up the street.
"
2981,-1,"And we would divide ourselves into teams, um, and he would have on a little piece of paper in a cigar box, um- You know, the categories would be sports, you know, um, latest news- And then I had a Raheem box, which was all Doctor Seuss stuff or anything he had g- he knew that I would know answers to.
"
2982,-1,"And so, she kept pushing me and pushing me, and I just- You know, it was easier to work um- I was doing retail, and I thought I was gonna be a model.
"
2983,-1,"You know, I had all of this whole you know, pie in the sky idea of what my life was really gonna be like, and  she's telling me, go back to school.
"
2984,-1,"It used to be um, Recardo, Matias0, and Shmeka.
"
2985,-1,"And- But these were people who wanted to be educated, and most of their buildings were downtown near um, like um, Second and um, where that new Walmart is, down in Northeast.
"
2986,-1,"And um, Florida Avenue, U Street, Fourteenth and U, all of- You know, all of that used to be kind of Mm-hm.
"
2987,-1,"After the riots- After everything seemed to be torn up- I don't know how Ben's specifically was affected, but the movie theaters like you know, the Lincoln and all th- They were- They were gone.
"
2988,-1,"You b- You leave me in this room long enough, it's gonna be an afro.
"
2989,-1,"But, this used to be Chocolate City, right?
"
2990,-1,"You know, um, my- my first answer would be no Mm.
"
2991,-1,"because I didn't tr- I was very um, insecure- I lacked a lot of confidence during that time, and I only wanted to be around people that I knew and felt comfortable with.
"
2992,-1,"And um, so I went out there because I wanted to be in the- kind of that environment.
"
2993,-1,"I didn't wanna- I wanted to be on the high end of fashion, whatever.
"
2994,-1,"Out of all my- And if you were to meet my siblings, there would be no- no mistake about Mm-hm.
"
2995,-1,"Sister Mychael, she had to be the meanest woman that I've ever met in my entire life, okay?
"
2996,-1,"She made me wanna be my best cause I was not gonna let her embarrass me.
"
2997,-1,"Hecht's used to be there, so we used to go down and um, you know, hang out at the stores.
"
2998,-1,"And we'd- You know- We'd hang out and be stupid at the library.
"
2999,-1,"Okay, if I can be honest with you, Jasmine and I- because I got my driver's license at sixteen, didn't have a car.
"
3001,-1,"It used to be called Criterion Insurance.
"
3002,-1,"And he went out- He would be up at four in the morning cause his route was downtown, like the businesses downtown.
"
3003,-1,"Um, and um, he would get up first- I mean he would be gone.
"
3004,-1,"He'd be home like, you know, two o'clock from work.
"
3005,-1,"I was- cause I just knew that was gonna be the job that I had.
"
3006,-1,"So I go in and I meet with this woman, Devaughn, and she was sweet as can be.
"
3007,-1,"that it's gonna be okay.
"
3008,-1,"You know, Just come home because Andreah this is w- This is a big deal, and they might be targeting large cooperations.
"
3009,-1,"I felt like I had to be with my family.
"
3010,-1,"So, I- So, they were in elementary school, and I was like, I'm going up to volunteer at school cause I wanna be where my kids are.
"
3011,-1,"Bills couldn't be paid, none of that.
"
3012,-1,"what would that piece of advice be?
"
3013,-1,"Um, I think it would be um-  You know, things are gonna happen, you know?
"
3014,-1,"You're going to- There are gonna be times when you feel like, why am I going through- Why is this happening to me?
"
3015,-1,"You know, don't let- don't make it be a stopping block.
"
3016,-1,"You know, and when you look back on it, you'll see how that truly just helped you get to where you wanted to be.
"
3017,-1,"And so you know- We- And the- And the french fries had to be smothered in ketchup.
"
3019,-1,"Maybe your room is right next to my bedroom and- It got to be so- It made me wanna move because it was- it- I- I- I got the point where if I heard another Chuck Brown song, I was just gonna start throwing things.
"
3020,-1,"Mm, uh, that would be excluding- Only- The only time that I lived elsewhere was when I was in college and law school.
"
3021,-1,"That would be - Well uh, only- I went away to college really for like a semester so, uh, let me see.
"
3022,-1,"Um, except for my father told me this, um- The only whites that basically stayed- The majority of the whites that stayed were um, whites that did not have children, particularly girls because they did not want um, white- Whites did not want their girls to be around black guys.
"
3023,-1,"I mean, you know, all- m- Whenever I told somebody that I was from Southeast, and then I would say I was from Hillcrest, they'd be like, Oh that's not Southeast.
"
3024,-1,"So you know, if you consider that to be overt, no, it wasn't overt.
"
3025,-1,"But I do remember one time, that- But th- it was hurtful stuff because I remember one time that everybody- Well it wouldn't have been everybody, but I didn't get invited to a w- You know, the Jews have bar mitzvahs and bat mitzvahs, which is like their coming of age- You know, like um- It would be like our- Like, Hispanics have Qui- Quinceaneras, or something like that.
"
3026,-1,"Like, maybe for us it would be um- Oh yea- Mm.
"
3027,-1,"I don't know what the Hispanics- There was religious- It might just be cultural.
"
3028,-1,"Cause she lives in Southwest, so we all got to be really c- And she just was different.
"
3029,-1,"That was the place to be.
"
3030,-1,"He didn't want them to be that entrenched.
"
3031,-1,"Um, Georgetown and- and above- G- GW would be considered downtown, you know.
"
3032,-1,"Some people might consider that to be Georgetown because it's in proximity to Georgetown.
"
3033,-1,"But I never considered it be Georgetown because they call it Foggy Bottom first of all.
"
3034,-1,"But it turned out to be something more than that.
"
3035,-1,"I mean as academic r- -ly as Sydni may or may not be, it is not academically as rigorous, a- I can say for sure, as Harvard.
"
3036,-1,"So how did you end up- How did you- Because your dad was an attorney, is that why you wanted to be an attorney?
"
3037,-1,"Um, and he did- I really wanted to be a psychologist, and um, he did um, he did tell me that he thought I would make more m- I wanted to get um- I- I wanted to get a- maybe a big um-  I wanted to get a PhD in Psychology.
"
3038,-1,"Cause I didn't want anybody to ever say that I c- I didn't wanna ever say that I couldn't do it, but you know, I sort of wanted to be a social worker, something like that.
"
3039,-1,"And that- that's definitely something that I need to- You know, I'm getting really up in age, and I really need to um- You know, and I wish I had taken- And I hope you do this with your daughter, like maybe every weekend when she gets to be a certain age, just make it a point to take her once place.
"
3040,-1,"No I have not been a- as much of a tourist in my own town- own town as I should be.
"
3041,-1,"Um, well, w- what it used it to be as opposed to what it is now, uh, it was- it's the- the- the demographics of it have changed drastically since I grew up there from like nineteen sixty up through nineteen- I left there about nineteen seventy seven.
"
3042,-1,"it's a culture shock because I mean even in the city as a whole, you know, when you come in uh, down on U Street, you know, I mean the- the- just the whole profile of how DC used to be is going through a drastic change.
"
3043,-1,"They have a lot of l- rooftop things where they're up and even in the- my apartment building where I used to be they have a rooftop area where they can sit and- Oh wow.
"
3044,-1,"Um- And pimping can be used as a phrase of oh you looking good or you- okay okay.
"
3045,-1,"So a lot of history that has gone on that I got from like my parents and stuff you know, on how things used to b- be, where they would go.
"
3046,-1,"I said so that's gonna be your role model is a prisoner.
"
3047,-1,"They didn't have the proper training to be able to train the next generation because they were too young, you know.
"
3048,-1,"But the language that is unique to us- and one of the, uh, one of the kids was saying that you know we have to be bilingual because when we are, um, one of- as a matter of fact one of my friends, his- his, uh, his wife, her- her uh, father had a Ph.D. in African American Studies and uh, he wrote a book about Ebonics.
"
3049,-1,"what products can be sold.
"
3050,-1,"And they were talking about how sometimes the servants would be corrupt so that the owner- they never said master.
"
3051,-1,"uh, descendants were like, hey we need to be here too.
"
3052,-1,"That's an incredible journey for a people to take and still be here, still survive.
"
3053,-1,"The quali- the quality of education wasn't gonna be the same.
"
3054,-1,"You know, where it would be like ninety percent white and you know ten percent black and then it just slowly kept chopping down Mm-hm.
"
3055,-1,"You could take those songs from the sixties, play 'em today and it'd be the same.
"
3056,-1,"It's like the powers that be will turn a a blind eye to that.
"
3057,-1,"you know, but the amount of power that's gonna be there is gonna change.
"
3058,-1,"Those are the things that parents need to be - and that's like I said that's why that the museum is important, you know.
"
3059,-1,"And the same thing with, you know, I'm all for wanting to be yourself and all this o- other kind of stuff but if you've got dreads and you- especially one that you're not taking care of, you know, and you gonna go to an interview and you want a job working in a bank, okay.
"
3060,-1,"I had my, um,  one of my professors in- who happened to be my f- uh, fraternity advisor, um, Aliscia.
"
3061,-1,"But what happened which which Du Bois had had kind of saw coming is that integration would be the the downfall of us as a people.
"
3062,-1,"We had to be a hundred and fifty percent better than the average person coming out of a white school.
"
3063,-1,"Um, and on any given day, the kids would be playing in the alley.
"
3064,-1,"Um, we did not go from house to house so one of the things that was special and unique about the, um, T Street neighborhood and- and being there and being there at a very young age was as kids, we would go from one person's house to the other person's house all the time to play or if my parents had to be away, one of the other neighbors would babysit and they'd just have us come over and stay there until our parents came back and we'd spend the night and- at each other's houses and that sort of thing.
"
3065,-1,"And to- and to be part of that, and some places were more welcoming than others.
"
3066,-1,"Can you tell me about that experience, like what did it mean to be a- Not even just a black male at that time, but just to witness all of that?
"
3067,-1,"Um, it was a time when there was a- Thereafter was a curfew in the city so you couldn't be out after a certain hour and that sort of thing and that was a little hair-raising.
"
3068,-1,"Um, I want to be mindful of your time.
"
3069,-1,"Um,  and there were other th- there are other things going on but I didn't- I was too young, just kind of- know all about them and too young probably to be in some of them.
"
3070,-1,"That means that DC used to be a warm and friendly city.
"
3071,-1,"And I don't think that there's that sense of- of hope that sense of, um,  being able to be part of something.
"
3072,-1,"So, I lo- I feel like my father could be from Panama.
"
3073,-1,"But purple, I'd be like purple.
"
3074,-1,"And I'd be like, there go purp- there goes five purple!
"
3076,-1,"We used to be in the um, hallway.
"
3077,-1,"You gotta be home.
"
3078,-1,"I- I learned, like I have to share spaces with people I would be on my- I would come in the morning and all these different people woul- are on the floor, living in my house.
"
3079,-1,"And you know, my brother could- could a- could potentially be you know, could have gotten killed because of that.
"
3080,-1,"It's not gonna always be you know, a- positive things that are coming out of that.
"
3081,-1,"They have babies and And- and I- I mean, I'm not trying to say that that was the end all be all of the programs, but they didn't have no- anywhere to go.
"
3082,-1,"Because they w- g- they remember when this place when nobody really wanted to be here.
"
3083,-1,"And I would go in there and be like oh, oh yeah, we're all grown up, we can drink, uh.
"
3084,-1,"I thought it must be a benefit.
"
3086,-1,"Just be honest, right?
"
3087,-1,"And everybody would be mixed.
"
3088,-1,"Well, nobody wanted to be here, and now we have these businesses and I'm like man.
"
3089,-1,"There had to be three on site.
"
3090,-1,"I- I mean, why can't we why can't there be an inclusin uh- uh- a c- an um.
"
3092,-1,"I don't know what's gonna be built there.
"
3093,-1,"I know it's not gonna be for me.
"
3094,-1,"Because, I wanted to be a more a part of the- the solution, than a part of a problem.
"
3095,-1,"We know this is gonna always be an unjust society.
"
3096,-1,"Everything- but does it have to be so hard?
"
3097,-1,"Does inequality have to be so hard?
"
3098,-1,"I just I always think there's gonna be some type of irocracy somewhere but I mean, hierera- hierarchy.
"
3099,-1,"Like, you know, like boom, boom, boom, but the end of the day, g- does it have to be so hard?
"
3100,-1,"I gotta do community service, and this gentrification, I wanna be up- I- I- I wanna fight this.
"
3101,-1,"And then when I found- when GOLES gave me the vehicle,  I decided to be a part of the solution.
"
3102,-1,"And I w- I would be like um I would tell the- I would tell business owners.
"
3103,-1,"All the parks gotta be closed.
"
3104,-1,"The parks gotta be closed.
"
3105,-1,"She thought I was gonna be a cab baby.
"
3106,-1,"It used to be a pool.
"
3107,-1,"I used to be scared to death of that building.
"
3108,-1,"Like, that was the place to be.
"
3109,-1,"Got a l- got a little older, wanted to be a little more, yeah.
"
3110,-1,"Wanted to be a little more- Do what I g- wanna do kind of thing.
"
3112,-1,"Y- and I thank my mom for that because it opened my eyes about a thing- to a lot of things that I criti- I learned to be a critical thinker.
"
3113,-1,"I was more of the peace maker, like come on brothers and sisters,  we don't need to be doing this.
"
3114,-1,"So, I think that I needed to be that, because this didn't make sense to me.
"
3116,-1,"Used to be the crack house.
"
3117,-1,"In Manhattan, it may be the largest.
"
3118,-1,"It might be the largest, I think it is.
"
3119,-1,"That's my- And the people who do know, it's unfortunate that people know that it's like, people's lives oversee politics and it shouldn't be like that.
"
3120,-1,"And and I would- looked up Lower East Side, and it happened to be some type of a blog or something.
"
3121,-1,"I think that in a couple of years, when they're ready to raise their children, or whatever the case may be, I think they're gonna move on up out of here.
"
3122,-1,"Or, the people who are here are gonna be moved out.
"
3123,-1,"The people who've been here, are gonna be moved out.
"
3124,-1,"It's always gonna be a difference between the poor and the rich.
"
3125,-1,"It's always gonna be there.
"
3126,-1,"But, I just feel like there's gonna be a lot of tension there.
"
3127,-1,"That could be a hospital.
"
3128,-1,"You know, but that might be a issue too because of the traffic.
"
3129,-1,"Is it gonna be affordable housing?
"
3130,-1,"Or is it gonna be another blue building?
"
3131,-1,"But we have to st- be careful with that because sometime, those upper class people get up in there and a lot of times, when even when you apply for subsidized housing, it says only four units are available.
"
3132,-1,"It should be reversed.
"
3133,-1,"It should only be four units available for the upper income and more of the units available for low income.
"
3134,-1,"But, at the same time, it might- it might perpetuate the whole project mentality, or whatever the case may be.
"
3135,-1,"You know what I mean, cause ten, that- that- that'll do enough people, but it's not gonna be like You could see that building above all the buildings in the whole skyline, like you shouldn't  see.
"
3136,-1,"You know, so it's like that whole It's like that whole thing of Now, the name is so hyped up that everybody wants to be out here.
"
3137,-1,"Or is it j- or- or should it be hyped up because of the people who've been here?
"
3138,-1,"It's gonna be somebody's euphoria.
"
3139,-1,"But it ain't- It's not- it's definitely not going to be what it is now.
"
3140,-1,"Think all the projects, ten, twenty years, all the projects are going to be co-op- co-ops, condos, something like that.
"
3141,-1,"And it was like, you know, we wanted to kind of g- get a change of scenery, a better- a better neighborhood and this action- Lower East Side used to be, you know, b- was kind of like a abandoned area.
"
3142,-1,"And one person would, um, you know, w- one person would be the person that's it.
"
3143,-1,"Um, well I would, you know, you'd be surprised- probably have- but we have a big backyard back there.
"
3144,-1,"And if it was a team though, um, you would catch me and I would just be out for the rest- you know, there was like a- a prisoner's thing, where I would have to stay there and, you know, until- exactly.
"
3145,-1,"But the catch is, on certain occasions if, um, if one person from like, say if I'm on the opposing team then I'm, you know, one of my teammates got caught, um, I can, you know if I can sneak- sneak to the base where, you know, where my- my- my teammates is at and tag  them before, you know, the other team is able to notice me then they'll be set free, so.
"
3146,-1,"Um, so she would be able to take care of me.
"
3147,-1,"And, um, I believe it's- I'm- I'm not- I'm not specfic- um, I'm not sure in regards to how specific it is when it comes down to can it be passed down.
"
3148,-1,"And I had, um,  an immune deficiency, and a- and so, um, me-  she used to be a computer operator, so.
"
3149,-1,"And then- and I used to be in and out of the hospital a lot, so it was something that I definitely had to- yeah.
"
3151,-1,"But, um- I'm gonna be twenty-five in November, so.
"
3152,-1,"And so the asthma would be the gateway.
"
3153,-1,"Where, you know, I'll get the respiratory, you know, respiratory- my respiratory- my breathing would be heavy and I'll, you know, I'll get sick from that.
"
3154,-1,"But then I'll be exposed to so many other different types of, um, germs and all that because my immune system was having a hard time fighting off just the asthma.
"
3155,-1,"I'm a lot more appreciative of- of just some of the simplest things, cause I mean, nobody thinks, you know, no seven year old- eight year old, you know, thinks about have them not- you know- you know, them dying or not being able to be - you know, grow up and everything like that.
"
3156,-1,"And you know, it was just something that I was- as a kid like, y- you know,  as a kid it wasn't like, oh wow I wanna be a business owner, but you know, just to see somebody who- who- you know, who looks like you or see like, one of your friend's, you know, parents, or you know, relatives running a- you know, running a business.
"
3157,-1,"So we used to have one- there used to be on Third Street, then there was another one that was down, I believe on Eighth Street and Avenue C. Eighth or Ninth Street or whatever.
"
3158,-1,"I think that there's not a problem, um, I think that you- you- you can't expect, you know, one neighborhood to be the same way it is all the time.
"
3159,-1,"Uh, but I do think that there-  when, you know, gentrification is that much of a big issue here, I think it's important to be able to, you know, to talk about it.
"
3160,-1,"Um, I- I thought that there coulda been more done in regards to, um, whether- whether it was to relieve the tension or whether it was to makes sure that, um,  people were given the fair treatment to be able to stay in their homes, especially if they've lived there for, you know, X amount of- I was always against you know, raising- you know, raising the rent to kick people who- kick people out who- w- we're the ones that, you know- you know, we made this community what it was.
"
3161,-1,"You know, and to just completely disregard them as if they were nothing, you know, as if they were nobody, so that you can, you know, be able to bring in somebody who's able to pay the, you know, pay the amount of rent that you want them to pay.
"
3162,-1,"And she was completely against it because she knew of course, um, if I was going there where rest of my friends were, you know, it was easy- more easily for me to be influenced to do, um, you know, kind of do the wrong thing.
"
3163,-1,"Like w- we really developed, you know, over the years, you know, campus like really, really became like, yeah wow, this is- this is great, this is what I want it to be.
"
3164,-1,"And I- a- and within that period that I was there, I developed a great relationship with the CEO, um, of the organization who happened to be friends with the city council member that was looking for, you know, some new talent, and was introduced to her.
"
3165,-1,"In regards to the amount of work that we had to do and, um, still be able to run a office at the same time and still put on events in the community, from January to July.
"
3166,-1,"And, um, and- which allows me to be able to work more independently, you know, just with myself and my mother, and just I- I have, you know, pretty much have a lot of control on regards to what type of events we wanna do.
"
3167,-1,"And, you know it- it's unfortunate that, you know- you know, um, they no longer could be here because of the fact that they can't afford it.
"
3168,-1,"But, uh, I just think that I wish there was more, um,  I mostly- I wish there was more that could be done to make sure-  exactly.
"
3169,-1,"I would consider that to be like, the Lower East Side.
"
3170,-1,"Yeah, my mom was actually trying to be a um,  a homesteader.
"
3171,-1,"I was like, I don't wanna be in the Lower East Side.
"
3172,-1,"A lot of, um, the not knowing how the rent was going to be for her once I started working full time.
"
3173,-1,"And saying, you know, now her rent is gonna be high.
"
3174,-1,"So i- it got to be.
"
3175,-1,"Who, um, is autistic and he needed someone to be here.
"
3176,-1,"He was fifteen at the time, and it was- he needed to be in the neighborhood where he was familiar with.
"
3177,-1,"You know, somebody has to be in care of your brother.
"
3178,-1,"I'll be living with that.
"
3179,-1,"Like, they painted all these nice colors and they put fancy tiles and, you know, they do all these things because this is where they assume they gonna be for the rest of their lives.
"
3180,-1,"And my mom would feed them on Sunday so she knew that we would be okay coming home.
"
3181,-1,"She knew how to blend in and make friends with the people so that we would be okay.
"
3182,-1,"You can't be a- a restaurant on the Lower East Side and not serve alcohol.
"
3183,-1,"And stuff that they you know, at three or four in the morning you should be sleeping.
"
3184,-1,"It's not even- I w- I wouldn't even say it's the white folks moving in because, I'm'a be honest with you, even as a kid we had a lot of white families that lived on the Lower East Side.
"
3185,-1,"And they- all of their kids went there, cause that's where they wanted their kids to be.
"
3186,-1,"That, you know, it's bad, it's- it's not a good place to be.
"
3187,-1,"Like, we have this air about us because that's the way the principal told the kids to be.
"
3188,-1,"You- You can't be serious.
"
3189,-1,"Where we have to fight for the right to stay here and still be a low income building.
"
3190,-1,"You know, Greenwich Village used- used to be, like, what we call Alphabet City is now Greenwich Village or Lower East Side.
"
3191,-1,"You know, so they've changed name, they've modified it, they've made it into what they wanted it to be.
"
3192,-1,"They understand what it means to be on the Lower East Side.
"
3193,-1,"So I mean, you know, you can't tell me what it's like to be on the Lower East Side when you didn't do any of those things.
"
3194,-1,"to have a- uh, uh, black guy uh, uh, uh Puerto Rican come to the households at that time, know what I'm saying, you gotta really really be like open minded to the whole situation and some people wasn't they didn't know too much English at that time.
"
3195,-1,"And I chose to be popular over knowledge.
"
3196,-1,"I pretty much never got in no tough situations, because one, uh- u- u- uh, to be a hundred and thirty-seven pounds, all your life, and fighting guys two hundred and ten, six feet, and making a- a- a- a re- a- a- r- a reputation for yourself, like like he ain't gonna run.
"
3197,-1,"And, if I'm thirty-eight, MK gotta be thirty-seven, thirty-eight also.
"
3200,-1,"It was supposed to be um, I talked about before the Lower East Side had fancy restaurants and art galleries.
"
3201,-1,"Just to keep the community how it used to be for somebody who been in it.
"
3202,-1,"But, what make us so different we can be in- in Alasta- Alaska and see one more and you can feel the bond still from Lower East Side.
"
3203,-1,"But, my nephew got it right now, so it's still gonna be in the family regardless and things like that.
"
3204,-1,"I- I- wish everybody the best and my goal in life, like I said, I tryna be that entrepreneur what and to make what I can make just to try to buy anything what's open.
"
3208,-1,"To be thirty-eight, and the cops still tryna put him in, for no reason.
"
3209,-1,"I can go to sleep, and wake up in the morning and still be at peace.
"
3210,-1,"That'd be nice.
"
3211,-1,"By all means necessary, you just can't build a building, and be like okay, this is for the youth.
"
3212,-1,"Know what I'm saying, you gotta it's- it gotta be open at a certain time.
"
3213,-1,"If not, they gonna be back on the corners.
"
3214,-1,"Somewhere they can be there from- from six to eight.
"
3215,-1,"Cause the I think it should be a free place.
"
3216,-1,"It don't have to be free.
"
3217,-1,"Everything don't have to be free.
"
3218,-1,"Yeah, and I think they figured maybe it would be a different thing, and also, I guess if you- At that time, if you applied for the housing projects and stuff, you- pretty much when you- you got the application you were approved, you had to go wherever they kind of put you, I guess.
"
3219,-1,"That was really close, that was like you could fall out of bed and and be there.
"
3220,-1,"Lived there for like three years, I actually had a roommate who was Carisma Kamilla, we'd be roommates there.
"
3221,-1,"You have to be on the lease, if you.
"
3222,-1,"You don't know- never know what the train is gonna be like.
"
3223,-1,"If you had one of those tops, then- and you pulled one of those out, we knew we would be in trouble because those tops just were made for skellzies.
"
3224,-1,"But, if you weren't back by six o'clock, then you'd there would be a problem with your next day's explorations, you know what I'm saying .
"
3225,-1,"So, you know, I- you know, I guess other kids who you know, did crazy things, you know, people you know, had to be monitored a little bit more.
"
3226,-1,"So, they kind of you know, le- places to live now, you know, and so, now, if y- I think pretty soon, if you don't have any money, you won't be living on the Lower East Side anymore.
"
6247,1," like a year of times i dont even be wanting to step out the house cause i feel like and shit thingsve im losing money than im gaining gas money and just be out god damn probably gonna come to pay for some drinks food gas some of it no know some kick it with folks but shit you got your shot
