"
4116,-1,"And that used to be the World Theater.
"
4117,-1,"It wouldn't be the movie that you'd see downtown this week.
"
4118,-1,"But it would be a a movie and you'd get the same quality.
"
4119,-1,"I didn't tell him That I might be his sister   Mh-hm.
"
4120,-1,"I said, well, he wanted us to be friends.
"
4121,-1,"And I said, cause he wanted us to be friends.
"
4122,-1,"I don't- It'll be fine.
"
4123,-1,"We seem to be doing better than when I was coming up.
"
4124,-1,"Cause the opportunities seem to be there.
"
4125,-1,"Cause I might not be out of the woods.
"

"
4127,-1,"And she had to be to work like seven.
"
4128,-1,"I can't stand to be late.
"
4129,-1,"And it turned out to be really good cause sh- the person she rented to was a school nurse.
"
4130,-1,"So, she said, um, when the lease is up, uh, they'll- it'll be good for them so they'll have their own room.
"
4131,-1,"Uh, it would be southwest Rochester.
"
4132,-1,"Uh, I was addicted very young as a young person to, uh, drugs, so it sort of followed that and uh, th- the lifestyle that I had back at, uh, you know tha- that time, it it move- moved us to different cities and stuff because, uh, we were in that, uh, trade at that time and so, uh, uh, caused me to be very, very mobile and, uh, really not putting down a lot of roots anywhere.
"
4133,-1,"Um, the city of Rochester, uh, would be just like, uh, the public market is for people that wanna come in from all over the region and visit the public market, buy food there.
"
4134,-1,"So, most of my life, uh, the sixty-three years that I've been here, uh, I've been in the city of Rochester, and I watched the city, uh, be very bustling, uh, when I was a young person with a- um, a bustling downtown, strong tax base, to where I am now that we see the city, it has a lot of challenges.
"
4135,-1,"And so there's a outcry, and an alarmist view that, uh, something really needs to be done about it.
"
4136,-1,"You find, uh, the policies now, uh, starting to be addressed and, um, uh, you starting to see maybe a little bit more compassion, uh, uh, around the, uh, criminal justice system incarcer- incarceration and everything taking, uh, uh, its turn.
"
4137,-1,"And, uh, not be impacted, uh, you know, adversely, uh, by, uh, a lot of decision making because, um,  it doesn't fit the DNA of who and what we are.
"
4138,-1,"It's not anything that's gonna be dismantled.
"
4139,-1,"They even taking, um,  uh, books today and maybe you could be able to do something about that.
"
4140,-1,"And so when you- when you have language like this here that denies what has happened, uh, to a people, and, uh, expect that that- to be alright just so you can breathe and feel comfortable about yourself, then it means that we haven't really made the strives that was- wa- was- we supposed to have maken.
"
4141,-1,"So, a lot of the, um, projects that, uh, the dominant society in Rochester wanted to put forth, uh, in terms of how the downtown was gonna be designed, how, uh, new housing was gonna come in for, uh, folks so, uh, we- we can get more people to come back into the city, and become residents increase the tax base and stuff like that.
"
4142,-1,"Uh, someone is gonna be a savior for us.
"
4143,-1,"Uh, that's the racism that is, uh, in, um, uh, the structures, whether it's, uh, uh, uh, redlining for, uh, insurance, um, making sure that, uh, a neighborhood is blackballed to where you can't get out of it or move, uh, uh, anywhere else and you're somewhat landlocked to where you basically can be.
"
4144,-1,"We could go down there look in the window and see him negotiating, uh, with the powers that be, uh, in the city for, uh, better jobs, better housing, uh, uh, you know, basically for blacks.
"
4145,-1,"Uh, more s- more so than there would be in the south.
"
4146,-1,"But, uh, she has a passion for community colleges and, uh, you know, she would like to be a president of one one day, so we- we- we'll have to see what happens.
"
4147,-1,"Uh, historically, uh, it may be something in the water, what have you, but, uh, the Nineteenth Century Freedom Movement, uh, is basically an international movement that was started here with Frederick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony.
"
4148,-1,"And so, uh, once again it could be, uh, something in the Genesee River or what- whatever, the Hemlock Lake or what have you, but, uh, very brilliant people come out of, uh, Rochester, uh, very decent and hardworking people of all, uh, races and creeds.
"
4149,-1,"Um, you know, there might be a little- little something to that but w- one thing is is that  for African Americans, uh, the- there wasn't that really mixing of, uh, uh, the races in the fifty and sixty, even though we were in the neighborhoods and stuff like that, there still wasn't that, you know.
"
4150,-1,"I mean, I guess in your study of it there's- the- the- there may be some keys and some things to basically look at, uh, in- in order to, um, detect or, you know, become aware of.
"
4151,-1,"And, um, be fond of telling folks of, uh, uh, your childhood because, uh, it was a good childhood.
"
4152,-1,"And even though Miss Donetta, she had her moments where she would show her favoritism to the white kids, Miss Stacia will be there to balance it out.
"
4153,-1,"It's just- kids are just so mean, you know, and then when you have teachers that wouldn't believe you when certain things happen, like they will be on the b- the bad kids' side, it kind of makes you feel vulnerable.
"
4154,-1,"You can be Rosa Parks.
"
4155,-1,"You can be Thurgood Marshall.
"
4156,-1,"Not only that but I've also experienced my- I also learned my talents, like I didn't know I could be that good at music until I got in middle school.
"
4157,-1,"I had a couple of friends but they were upperclassmen, and so every time an upperclassmen friend would graduate, I would be by myself.
"
4158,-1,"I wanted to go to UGA and be in the band, um, I got accepted into UGA and I had a scholarship at UGA.
"
4159,-1,"But, I wish all the schools in the city would be on the same level I guess.
"
4160,-1,"But when you have people in office that wanna be in office just to have power and to collect a check, that's when it becomes a problem.
"
4161,-1,"Like it's- it's taking too long, to be honest.
"
4162,-1,"Um, I remember having little workshops and classes, and now this-  this may be a little bit too inappropriate but I remember having this one discussion about  sex.
"
4163,-1,"Basically- I felt like, to me personally, I felt like you brought in a lot of people that, um, talked to us about, you know, how it is to be a woman.
"
4164,-1,"From- so you're twenty-eight, so you had to be, what, fifteen, sixteen?
"
4165,-1,"So it's a little- it can be a little bit harsh, I guess.
"
4166,-1,"And my mom, she doesn't like to be around drama like that, especially when it comes down to business.
"
4167,-1,"It was something totally different because I'm not be - I'm not used to being a whole bunch of white people  like that.
"
4168,-1,"Like I don't- I don't know, it's kind of- it's kind of hard to explain to be honest.
"
4169,-1,"But it's like, now I can talk to anybody and be okay with it.
"
4170,-1,"And I was so livid, like I got that kid and I drove off because I probably woulda killed that man, to be honest.
"
4171,-1,"And I- I couldn't be prouder, but.
"
4172,-1,"And that's- it's- that's the same thing, I had to get up early and do my Bible study so that I could be able to teach you guys like, right?
"
4173,-1,"Right, and be - and know each other cause we were all in- and nobody seemed to really know each other.
"
4174,-1,"And you can't be afraid to do that.
"
4175,-1,"You can't change who you are, so stop being afraid to be wonderful.
"
4176,-1,"But just being on this pedestal of you need to do this, you need to do that, you need to be married by this age, you need to have kids by this age- it's a little bit difficult, especially coming from your mom and your grandma.
"
4177,-1,"Can I just be me for once?
"
4178,-1,"And I get it, I totally get it, you- you know, you want your parents to be happy, all that.
"
4179,-1,"So, um, that's what I'm gonna be doing in the next two weeks.
"
4180,-1,"Yeah, I'll be leaving in two weeks.
"
4181,-1,"um, because the ROI is going to be high, right?
"
4182,-1,"Okay, so turn that into something that can be profitable.
"
4183,-1,"People with pay- for like, work for- that's like you're teaching them kind of how to be entrepreneurs.
"
4184,-1,"So they're- if this person's more interested in me feeding the homeless, well part of my facility will be, um, you know, homeless outreach.
"
4185,-1,"have job skills, part of my facility will be resume writing and interview skills, Right.
"
4186,-1,"And it could- all those things, it could be like you take one guy, you know, you take Bobby and Bobby comes in.
"
4187,-1,"All those things could be housed under one thing, it's really just about how you're going to market yourself and your ideas, so people will give you money.
"
4188,-1,"Like these are things that are very tangible things that will be very helpful to the community, and I think you can do it.
"
4189,-1,"Like, um,  of course, you know, my mom used to be a caterer.
"
4190,-1,"Granted, I still remember the recipe, but just talking to her about you know, growing up and talking about how to be a woman.
"
4191,-1,"It was almost like a blur, to be honest.
"
4193,-1,"I might be wrong on that but I think he was.
"
4194,-1,"But she should be starting to work at the post office soon.
"
4195,-1,"I don't remember playing with kids a lot, to be honest.
"
4196,-1,"We used to be able to let our dog out, and she just run around the yard free, without a leash.
"
4197,-1,"So I'm happy to be from there.
"
4198,-1,"I just thought it was cool but, um, my mom was like, we may be able to get our old house back.
"
4199,-1,"I don't know how we got it back honestly, but we were able to get that house, it was nice to be back in my childhood home.
"
4201,-1,"But she would always be like, you can do better than this Dionisio this is not you.
"
4202,-1,"And, um, he was in the jazz- the jazz band, and I would always be like, Darryll let me play y'all music.
"
4203,-1,"I was probably just- I was like, I don't wanna be at this school, it's a lame school, but.
"
4204,-1,"And I just couldn't like- that's why I was like, I'm'a come in here and I'm'a be first chair over all y'all.
"
4206,-1,"It can be anything embarrassing or just a awful hat, awful looking hat.
"
4207,-1,"My- my s- I'm- I'm'a be honest, my senior did not care about my hat and like, she just put- it's like- it's like she put it together last minute or something, but.
"
4208,-1,"Like, it had beads hanging from it, it would be just jiggling and stuff, and like-  it was just- it was distracting- I think it had some feathers on it too.
"
4210,-1,"Anyway, I had- I had my stuff in like, a little flip book- like an index card book, and I would put like, where I'm supposed to be for this set.
"
4211,-1,"so- and it would be numbered, like you had a white one, a red one, and a yellow one.
"
4212,-1,"And if somebody's not right, he'll, like, call 'em out and be like, that's not right you need to move like, two steps over.
"
4213,-1,"You might be a little bit off from your spot, but you gotta make that arc or that diagonal, but.
"
4214,-1,"But you have to be in the, you know, picture.
"
4215,-1,"You didn't wanna be drum major?
"
4216,-1,"I never wanted to be drum major, nope.
"
4217,-1,"So why was it important for you to be section leader?
"
4218,-1,"Um, my hats- I don't remember what my hats were to be honest with you.
"
4219,-1,"What- ultimately, what will be - what do you with this, and then is that your dream job?
"
4220,-1,"Ultimately, what I would want to do,  um, is probably be like an editor for like, a big magazine.
"
4221,-1,"I'll be ready by then.
"
4222,-1,"Like, I'll- I'll be ready to throw my coins.
"
4223,-1,"I remember my mom used to always try to get us to do like- she wanted me to be in dance or something.
"
4224,-1,"And like, and she wanted my brother to be on step team.
"
4225,-1,"what was going on, so I could be kind of hip.
"
4226,-1,"It had to be like, last summer-ish, summer- spring, summer.
"
4227,-1,"And, um, so I went and she was like, hi would you like to- would you be interested in working in my d- in this department?
"
4228,-1,"So she was like, she'll be perfect over here.
"
4229,-1,"It used to be very violent.
"
4232,-1,"Contact- Yeah, I saw her it had to be about Yeah.
"
4233,-1,"And I actually- to be honest with you, I liked the fact that we moved out to Hahira way better than being in the city.
"
4234,-1,"And then, when school started, like I guess it cause I never had the opportunity to be the new kid.
"
4235,-1,"Then, not only that, when the games come in, be - people put money on they games.
"
4236,-1,"And then right, it's the stuff he can see, but then it's the people that's just way too strong that's like on they- on the defensive side, that's like most- like a lot of teams that I went again- that we've went against, like, the right side be more they fast, strong, and real like intensifying people.
"
4237,-1,"Like It- be out playing that game- like, does it feel different like in a locker room, on the field?
"
4238,-1,"What do you- what does it mean to be on those courts?
"
4240,-1,"We would- we'd be a fool.
"
4242,-1,"Now that's gonna be hard.
"
4243,-1,"And, I see my next one man, that's gonna be really hard.
"
4245,-1,"You can play, might not be how you want to play.
"
4246,-1,"And, and I'll end up trying to be a good big brother.
"
4247,-1,"And then the other thing I wanted to ask you about is did you tell me you wanted to be a veterinarian one time?
"
4248,-1,"But now what would be your dream job?
"
4249,-1,"And, for what he stands for, it's not more or less St- for what people is making it out to be, I guess.
"
4250,-1,"I remember, we was in- we'd just be in gym.
"
4252,-1,"Like, it's weird, cause I'm st- even today, like I have friends they'll be like, oh, do you know so and so?
"
4253,-1,"I would be fired.
"
4254,-1,"And I for someth- something within my spirit told me like, this will be the only bike I will ever have.
"
4255,-1,"You- you didn't like to be by yourself?
"
4256,-1,"Uh, Oklahoma, certain places I would be in, had spirits,  What does that- Spirits, what does that mean?
"
4257,-1,"Had to be like maybe six, seven.
"
4258,-1,"What about- So- and, Barton used to be like before it went to middle sch- cause it was middle school at one point.
"
4259,-1,"You gonna be getting in enough fights.
"
4260,-1,"Which those kids who are supposedly to be - Like everybody's college prep.
"
4261,-1,"Why did I spend all my- I could be putting my ideas into Mm.
"
4262,-1,"So they gonna bully, I'll be the biggest bully, cause that's not allowed.
"
4263,-1,"You're supposed to be jumping in and saying stuff.
"
4264,-1,"Used to be on the back s- yeah.
"
4265,-1,"Oh, no it was kind of odd cause I just happened to be in a Valdosta mall.
"
4266,-1,"And told me she would be contacting me.
"
4267,-1,"Say I'll be right back.
"
4268,-1,"Kids today you gotta be worried, okay that got a gun, they carrying drugs dah dah dah dah.
"
4269,-1,"And like, trying to be strong for everybody, you know, and nobody can't see me cry.
"
4270,-1,"I'm supposed to be crying everyday.
"
4271,-1,"Cause her dad told her that she needs to be more like me.
"
4272,-1,"I said, be more like me?
"
4273,-1,"She needs to be more like me and hold it in.
"
4274,-1,"Don't be more like me.
"
4275,-1,"No, I'm just saying, what are we supposed to be talking about?
"
4276,-1,"The funny thing, he tells her, she needs to be more like me.
"
4277,-1,"The person she definitely does not want- Only thing she would wanna be more like me like now, she's working on being a teacher.
"
4278,-1,"Sombody told somebody to be like me?
"
4279,-1,"Be like me.
"
4280,-1,"You should be like your sister.
"
4281,-1,"And she should be more like me.
"
4282,-1,"They might not be as smart as you are, but if they didn't do the things that you might consider as little or beneath you, then you couldn't do what you do.
"
4283,-1,"Like that's- li- I know you and your mom- mom gonna be there, whatever, loyalty.
"
4284,-1,"So like, my- me, I'm saying, like where I work at, my boss, like I should be loyal.
"
4285,-1,"But being loyal now means to some people, that you are going to be dishonest, discredit yourself, to save, or to make the one that's in charge look like how could I say, hot cheddar.
"
4286,-1,"be able to- wherever home was, to go back home.
"
4287,-1,"Loyalty, gonna be there where you're my ride or die.
"
4288,-1,"Some of them might be seventeen.
"
4289,-1,"I can be more at ease.
"
4290,-1,"Be inside before the streetlight come on.
"
4291,-1,"So we would just rake 'em all to the outside into a circle around the two trees and that would be our racetrack.
"
4292,-1,"You don't have to necessarily tell me their names, cause they'll be redacted anyway.
"
4293,-1,"Still had fun, but could be very responsible in that way.
"
4294,-1,"I- I don't worry will I be able to pick up the phone and call my sister or my brothers.
"
4295,-1,"It's knowing that I'm connected to a group of people that don't get to choose not to be connected to me.
"
4296,-1,"After school, we'd be there.
"
4297,-1,"Cause the tablecloth had to be on the table.
"
4298,-1,"But I didn't wanna be Denine anymore.
"
4299,-1,"I wanted to be Cassi, that's who I am.
"
4300,-1,"And that's who I need to be.
"
4301,-1,"Funny thing is now, I- I find that to be hilarious cause I appreciate that in my professional life, or whatever, I'm Bretton and in my home life and for those who are really close to me, I feel- I feel good that I had that identity as Marc in this space, um, but I- I remember being really silly about that then.
"
4302,-1,"Um, so Yolanda was probably the beginning of me trying to figure out who I wanted to be outside of my family.
"
4303,-1,"But then I decided I wanted to be a cheerleader.
"
4304,-1,"But I wanted to do that, I wanted to be a cheerleader.
"
4305,-1,"And, um, in the midst of all that, still wanting to get good grades, still wanting to be academically successful, cause that's important.
"
4306,-1,"Wanting to do band too, it was this I need to be my own person.
"
4307,-1,"Because I thought it was gonna be fun.
"
4308,-1,"I thought it was gonna be a way to meet new friends.
"
4309,-1,"You know it's so funny, to be so smart, and have such great test scores and all that, they wanted to keep me out of gifted.
"
4310,-1,"It wasn't meant to be.
"
4311,-1,"I am definitely a Wildcat and I'm happy to be a Wildcat.
"
4312,-1,"I'll always be a Wildcat, first and foremost.
"
4313,-1,"You were there- you- you were supposed to be there, to support us.
"
4314,-1,"We want you to be fully productive people and contributing members of society.
"
4315,-1,"The band room was like the center of my high school universe, it- There before school, there during lunch, whether we were supposed to be there or not.
"
4316,-1,"I wanted to be a part of Friday Night Lights.
"
4317,-1,"I wanted to be on the field.
"
4318,-1,"I wanted to be a part of something that is just Valdosta tradition and history.
"
4319,-1,"Wanting to be in the principal's office weird.
"
4320,-1,"Because I couldn't be there when he got there, because I was a- a Black girl in- their house.
"
4321,-1,"Because those kids could be brutal.
"
4322,-1,"And in my mind it was going to be a similar experience.
"
4323,-1,"And so they needed to meet basically certain quotas and I didn't earn my right to be there.
"
4324,-1,"I have the ability to be successful.
"
4325,-1,"I have every quality that it takes to be where I am in my career, but I don't think I would've had that experience, had I not been at a place like Fred.
"
4326,-1,"So we had a Democratic convention, mock convention where we go through all that process of you know, figuring out for each delegation what the vote was gonna be.
"
4327,-1,"So who the potential party's nominee would be for president.
"
4328,-1,"And so far the school has some ridiculous ninety something percent accuracy rate of predicting who the presidential nominee will be.
"
4329,-1,"And you don't get to be - you don't get to feign ignorance.
"
4330,-1,"So let it be for that purpose.
"
4331,-1,"And raising those concerns, will continue to go from class to class and there'll be some changes there.
"
4332,-1,"And I don't know that I ever thought I was going to be in Charlotte forever, but buying my first home was a milestone.
"
4333,-1,"I didn't feel like, that's where my adult life needed to be.
"
4334,-1,"Be closer to family.
"
4335,-1,"Charlotte never felt like home, and although Atlanta's not Valdosta and it never will be, there's something about being in Georgia that feels like home.
"
4336,-1,"So I'm going to select to have my computer open, but not gonna really be using it a lot.
"
4337,-1,"It used to be nice.
"
4338,-1,"And Jed used to be like, man- You know Jed used to always say, man come over to my house man.
"
4339,-1,"And be on the eighth grade team, because, you know, we wanted to carry on that tradition.
"
4340,-1,"The church would be so packed you can't even hardly ge- find a seat.
"
4341,-1,"I wanted to be Vittorio.
"
4342,-1,"I really didn't wanna be here.
"
4343,-1,"But I always like to be - as I so call say the boss.
"
4344,-1,"Regardless to where I'm at, or wherever I may go, or wherever I may be, you know what I'm saying.
"
4345,-1,"Well- Well one night be and Calvin was at a- a part- Hold on let's let this plane, do extra.
"
4346,-1,"You know what I'm saying, because for you to be hurting like that, and then I mean I always feel, that, you know what I'm saying.
"
4347,-1,"So I feel that I  probably, would be the first one to- something major to happen to.
"
4349,-1,"It was meant for me to go, it was meant for me to be there.
"
4350,-1,"I don't care it could be twenty other people that smarter her in the whole wide world, but she my genius.
"
4351,-1,"It's, you know I would like to be in a position where- You know what I'm saying.
"
4352,-1,"Don't you wanna be in a- in a position man where you can help your children?
"
4356,-1,"Um, so let's talk ab- a little bit about, um, going back to kind of the community, you- like they're people, that are doers like  if you could kind of give- If you could change one thing about Valdosta, what would it be?
"
4357,-1,"And I feel like, if you're willing and you're really trying, you know what I'm saying, it should be shot.
"
4359,-1,"But just staying with your mommy and daddy to be staying with your mommy and daddy.
"
4360,-1,"It's- it's going to be a pattern.
"
4361,-1,"I would just love to be an influence of some type to my community.
"
4362,-1,"You know what I'm saying, whatever it may be.
"
4363,-1,"Um, because, uh, the people that lived in the housing projects when I- when we were growing up at first, were people who were using, uh, that Valdosta Housing Authority to be a stepping stone to something else.
"
4364,-1,"Then we started to get people who did not mind, uh, living in low income housing and just settled into that lifestyle that is, uh, very much, uh, can be stagnant if you choose not to do something different.
"
4365,-1,"We- bi- basically had, what I would consider to be a legal, um, segregation, because when they, built uh, JL Newbern Middle School, they built it to serve the students- the children who lived on the East Side and the South Side of town.
"
4366,-1,"We had so much time to be social.
"
4367,-1,"And so I was never one of those people that just needed to be on the team.
"
4368,-1,"And I understood his method because he wanted to be sure that those, that wanted to learn were in a place where they could learn what they need to learn.
"
4369,-1,"And the only thing he said to me, was that you should never allow anybody to move you from where you know you should be.
"
4370,-1,"Don't ever let anyone put you out of the position that you know you should be in.
"
4371,-1,"Is that what inspired you to be a history teacher?
"
4372,-1,"Because I- I- I don't feel like you- you can really be cognizant of what's going on in the world at the present if you don't have an understanding of why things are like they are.
"
4373,-1,"Well, the fact was that I- I wasn't, um, you know, going to do anything differently, because since I was not leaving home, I didn't have to you know, be worried about trying to spend my last few days, or weeks in town with- with my friends.
"
4374,-1,"And so I would really like to explore what it would be like to teach college classes.
"
4375,-1,"And the- the whole premise of the movie is that you have a man who is innocent of a double murder to be convicted and sentenced to death.
"
4376,-1,"And it seems like that- that's one of the dynamic things about life is that you can be a person that sees the good, in everything and everybody and in the end, the world turns on you.
"
4377,-1,"To- to do right by people, even if you realize that you're not d- being done fairly because my parents always told me that I would never be held responsible for how somebody treated me.
"
4378,-1,"If you were to have the dream weekend, what would it be?
"
4379,-1,"Um, my- my typical dream weekend would be  You know, just I wouldn't even say being in it- in a- in an exotic place.
"
4380,-1,"And be with the people who are like minded.
"
4381,-1,"An- an- and we've always been taught that you know, god should be the center.
"
4382,-1,"And that, um, it's, you know, good to be able to know god.
"
4383,-1,"Um, now as far as me being in ministry, um, when I was younger I had some ideas about some things that I was going to do and how I was going to do it and I had, um,  a near death experience that allowed me to see, just how quickly you know, life could be gone.
"
4384,-1,"And it allowed me to see that there may be some things that I had planned, that god did not plan.
"
4385,-1,"I'm thinking about college a few months down the line and, um,  I was riding, uh, in a car uh, with my cousin and we crossed the- uh, a busy intersection, but of course we had looked to be sure that there was no onc- oncoming traffic.
"
4386,-1,"Uh, wanna be a actor.
"
4387,-1,"You know, like, probably be like the next Eddie Murphy.
"
4388,-1,"And that's when you know living how to be homeless, and then not being homeless, you know, I pretty much know what they would go through.
"
4389,-1,"You know, cause not knowing what somebody may think, or be like oh, he homeless.
"
4390,-1,"Even though it has been a couple of talks about that in the news that some people fake to be homeless got a lot of money, and then got arrested for it.
"
4391,-1,"Don't be stuck as no cashiers, no cook.
"
4392,-1,"You know, it's gonna be like, some struggles here and there.
"
4393,-1,"Cause if it wasn't for her, to encourage me and pray and everything, I don't where I would be at.
"
4394,-1,"Sometime, she can be a little bit nagging sometimes, or just always ask a lot of questions.
"
4395,-1,"Uh, how long you gonna be gone?
"
4396,-1,"And knowing now, as I'm getting older, you know, I'm probably won't even be qualified anyway due the fact that, you know, if you got asthma, you automatic disqualified.
"
4397,-1,"Even if just to be a garbage man or something.
"
4398,-1,"So, she wanted me cause she know I do great job with my results and stuff, so she figured, well since he don't wanna promote me for whatever reason that may be, maybe she'll promote me manager.
"
4399,-1,"Cause I told my big boss, I said, well where do the safe normally be at at this particular store?
"
4402,-1,"I'm gonna be gone too.
"
4403,-1,"I'll just have to lock them doors and- and- and be done with it and just take orders in drive through.
"
4404,-1,"I'll know where I will be at.
"
4405,-1,"But if it ain't for gas, it might just be for my stove.
"
4406,-1,"I- uh- I- I- Look at your cousin dude just sit there just be quiet while you gave me that little speech.
"
4407,-1,"So, the second go around, I wasn't even sposta be at the bar.
"
4408,-1,"I was sposta still be at work closing.
"
4411,-1,"Cause they say she don't do it they were gonna close Taco Bell down for two weeks, or whatever case may be.
"
4413,-1,"So I guess they tryna be like Florida I guess.
"
4414,-1,"Be done with it.
"
4416,-1,"Other then everybody's upbringings may be a little bit different, but everybody had the same chance that you have.
"
4417,-1,"some may have a better chance because they parents may be little bit well off a little bit, or may had the extra means, but I wouldn't say I wouldn't have that deterred you from not getting to what you need to get to just because of that.
"
4418,-1,"I said, even if I was to be like Chucky put the little base inside of you, I'm like she getting pregnant, I don't care.
"
4419,-1,"And then get twins, it'd be alright.
"
4420,-1,"What piece of advice would you be?
"
4421,-1,"Don't give up cause it may seem tough now, you know, it may be like, you may experience like a little struggle, or you may feel like, oh this person's being hard on you, or or you feel like you can't make it.
"
4422,-1,"Or, be in a better position than them.
"
4423,-1,"So now, since they all gone, I'm next in line to be the assistant.
"
4424,-1,"He used to be a custodian at a university.
"
4425,-1,"I wor- I took a night job so that I could be home in the daytime, so I had him in the daytime.
"
4426,-1,"And she had been my rock and so this was the opportunity for me to be her rock, so.
"
4427,-1,"You know I close one, but another one came open because the lady she worked for, you know, she was ailing, my grandmother was ailing so she couldn't no longer be her caregiver to her, so.
"
4428,-1,"I mean you have to understand, coming from a poor perspective and being able to do some things that you thought you'd never be able to do, travel, eat well, travel, and just have a good time.
"
4429,-1,"She always wanted to be a part of it, so.
"
4430,-1,"I wanted her to be able to see some of the world.
"
4432,-1,"We got a lot to be thankful for.
"
4434,-1,"I don't want her to be the person that when people see her coming, they say, ugh.
"
4435,-1,"I want her to be a person that people will like.
"
4436,-1,"And be glad to have around.
"
4437,-1,"Um, so, I think she gonna be okay.
"
4438,-1,"He's gonna be a handful.
"
4439,-1,"But he's gonna be all boy.
"
4440,-1,"He is as cute as he wants to be.
"
4441,-1,"And he's a joy to be around.
"
4442,-1,"So, I see Danaya's persis- persistence as the same as Dishawn's when it comes to- It might be different interests, but their persistence is the same.
"
4443,-1,"And we were in the room and all of a sudden this person come out the adjoining room, which I had no idea she was going to be there either.
"
4445,-1,"I've been able to, uh, travel abroad I- I never thought I'd be able to do that.
"
4446,-1,"And I'm driving so fast, but I'm- I'm trying to be aware of my driving so I won't wreck, you know, wreck, cause I needed to get there.
"
4447,-1,"And- and be home, but at that point, when she returned home, I told god thank you.
"
4448,-1,"I- uh, maybe that could be a expression.
"
4449,-1,"You're not gonna be any good to her if you don't settle down and- and take care of yourself, so you can get there.
"
4450,-1,"He was absent father, but when he- Father got there, I mean when the kid got on top, the father wanted to be in the limelight, but he didn't forget where he came from.
"
4451,-1,"Um, Just keeping 'em involved in something positive so they wouldn't be a product of the streets.
"
4452,-1,"But if you don't want my help, don't waste my time because there- there might be that one child out there that really wants to change.
"
4453,-1,"We have different programs they can be involved in.
"
4455,-1,"Oh, she had to be at least about seventy-five.
"
4456,-1,"Last question, if you could leave a piece of advice, what would that be?
"
4457,-1,"No, I- I couldn't be no maid, so I didn't do that.
"
4458,-1,"What was two dollars like today, what would that be?
"
4459,-1,"So, what made say you know, what, I???????Ä?????????Ä?? go to I???????Ä?????????Ä?? go to beauty school and instead of working at the coffee shop, and you know that you weren't gonna be a maid.
"
4460,-1,"It wasn't never fixed like it's supposed to be, cause old timey uh, carpenters, you know they didn't measure nothing.
"
4461,-1,"Like, MLK, and how that seemed to be did it did you feel- did it feel different?
"
4462,-1,"And stores, I remember Walgreens used to be downtown.
"
4463,-1,"And they tried to be nice, but you could tell, they- it hadn't got there.
"
4464,-1,"Do remember like the first time that you went to a place that ha- used to be whites and colors and that you went in?
"
4465,-1,"And see, if you can't be nice, and I wasn't nice, you know, that nice.
"
4466,-1,"Just something you could do differently, what would it be?
"
4467,-1,"I had surgery, and I couldn't lift and help with 'em, you know, getting 'em in and out the shampoo bowl and I sh- I had to stop that cause the Nurses are real lazy now, they ain't like they used to be.
"
4468,-1,"You said, I don't need to be on this boat.
"
4469,-1,"It used to be a time t- twelve o'clock, we gonna turn that TV on you know, to watch l- Love of Life but now, it don't make no difference.
"
4470,-1,"Cause I know you don't be in the shop all day.
"
4471,-1,"But, it still ain't like it used to be, so I been just really going down, it look like ever since then, but other than that.
"
4473,-1,"Mm  No, I think it was just availability, I guess, would be the There you go.
"
4474,-1,"So, I was uh, even though I could do the class work, they say by definition, in city school, you had to be six.
"
4475,-1,"Be honest with you, I couldn't tell a difference.
"
4476,-1,"Cause I think it- it- it helped because you don't get kids come down right be - from a junior high setting to a high school settings.
"
4477,-1,"Like, farmers and all, they would hire uh, someone like beacon uh i- be the, I guess, um  just like now with the Hispanics, you have someone that's actually the lead person, Mm-hm.
"
4478,-1,"So, she would- the people in the neighborhood that wanted to work, they would be more or less up under her umbrella.
"
4479,-1,"And once the 'bacca was cooked, then we would take the tobacco off the stick and put it in these big sheets and then it would go off to the warehouse to be sold.
"
4480,-1,"The next level would be ripe, and then just like you- pruning I guess.
"
4481,-1,"I started working Strickland- I would go to Strickland Cotton Mills, I?????ould work I would got to sch- wo- school all day long, I would get off and be a Strickland Cotton Mill at four o'clock and I would work a eight hour shift five or six days a week.
"
4482,-1,"He said, I already instructed these guys, whenever you might not be at your post, or whatever you're doing to help them, that I had already authorized you to get your school work every day while you're here at work.
"
4483,-1,"And be separated from their family, their children, and that's something I didn't want, cause my daughter was just born.
"
4484,-1,"I guess it was more gen around to make sure you gonna be able to receive instructions and, um,  and move forward.
"
4485,-1,"So in my basic training- in fact, even in basic training,  I was able to um, I was given a position as the dorm chief that would be over all the s-  offic- over the troops, you know.
"
4486,-1,"And we never seen those guys they w- they- we was- they would be with us during the day, in fact one of 'em was a, uh  the Hispanic guy was a um what we call disc jockeys back then.
"
4487,-1,"You decided to leave because you didn't want to be having this remote Right Mm.
"
4488,-1,"N- the- shipping, receiving, and pulling the parts for the components to be built, mm-hm.
"
4489,-1,"So, they have to be inspected and you got to make sure you got each boxes serialized separate to make sure you got the right batteries and all that stuff.
"
4490,-1,"It's gonna be an amazing experience.
"
4491,-1,"He saw the s- or he'd say, be careful who you let sit in that seat on the other side.
"
4492,-1,"You know d- t- it might be sk- crazy or strange, but,  when my mom died, it was I mean, that's expectations.
"
4493,-1,"A- and And I th- guess wh- when you've been shut out so much of what you've perceived to be, um, validated as a people, um, you go from being kidnapped, to being, you know, bought over here and being enslaved and you being told you was free, but you're not free.
"
4494,-1,"I guess we had to be accepted.
"
4495,-1,"The- e- what a- what a person s- what a person say, don't really have to make you- you don't have to be that.
"
4496,-1,"It's not I bl- I- I- I had a concept that if anybody gonna be hurt, I can take it.
"
4497,-1,"Let it be me.
"
4498,-1,"What would that piece of advice be and who would you leave it to?
"
4499,-1,"Like if- if everybody applied that I think we would be in a very different situation.
"
4500,-1,"And so the house was nice three be - two bedroom.
"
4501,-1,"It's on- On the south side of town, by, they called it, the club used to be Fifth Inn, and uh, Lake Park Road.
"
4502,-1,"Coming up in that area, where the tobacco warehouses used to be.
"
4503,-1,"I wanted to be the first black astronaut, but these women.
"
4504,-1,"So, I didn't like doing my arm, while I listened to him, so I wanted something easy with three little valve thinking that was gonna be easy to play.
"
4505,-1,"But actually, I found out, that that's really what- that's about the hardest thing you can do, you know, cause you got your lips got to be in shape.
"
4506,-1,"I said, sir, uh, um, We just initiated him and we uh, we- we put him in- out there in the dumpster, to thought he was gonna be done got out by now.
"
4507,-1,"Shoot, I don't know he might be still there, I don't know.
"
4508,-1,"Well, after I left high school, that's when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to be.
"
4509,-1,"I know Tibisay told me say I'd be a interesting character this.
"
4510,-1,"We'll be back.
"
4511,-1,"We got to get some more parts, but uh, we'll be back again.
"
4512,-1,"Couldn't be n- But she cussing us out.
"
4513,-1,"And after all this breaking these bricks, you would think all the noise and the dust that I'm making s- if anything's under there, they'll be gone.
"
4514,-1,"I told the people, I said look, I'll- I- I'll be back.
"
4515,-1,"Go get- I went and got about five bombs and threw up under the house and told them I'd be back tomorrow.
"
4516,-1,"All these people spending all this money, and it- I know it's gonna be something extra.
"
4517,-1,"Y- yo man, you gonna be together.
"
4518,-1,"It- I mean, it ain't as crazy as it used to be, they ain't all that shooting and stuff like they used to, but it goes on, but it just these folks over here is just too nosey.
"
4519,-1,"Oh, that be - uh, ooh, it been about two- four years ago.
"
4520,-1,"That's i-  Be honest.
"
4521,-1,"Go turn left and be bad, you gonna burn.
"
4522,-1,"And- and wire it up, band it up, shoot, you'd be finishing by- you could do a whole house in less than a day.
"
4523,-1,"Because I wanted to be the first black astronaut.
"
4524,-1,"But- But see, the- all it's doing is showing you what the future's gonna be.
"
4525,-1,"So, they were teaching you that what is gonna- the future gonna be.
"
4526,-1,"And that's what it's gonna be in the future.
"
4527,-1,"They might be there, we don't know.
"
4528,-1,"She'd say, they ain't supposed to be doing that.
"
4529,-1,"She said, well I don't wanna be here when it change.
