"Because I- I- I don't feel like you- you can really be cognizant of what's going on in the world at the present if you don't have an understanding of why things are like they are.
",-1,-1
"Well, the fact was that I- I wasn't, um, you know, going to do anything differently, because since I was not leaving home, I didn't have to you know, be worried about trying to spend my last few days, or weeks in town with- with my friends.
",-1,-1
"And so I would really like to explore what it would be like to teach college classes.
",-1,-1
"And the- the whole premise of the movie is that you have a man who is innocent of a double murder to be convicted and sentenced to death.
",-1,1
"And it seems like that- that's one of the dynamic things about life is that you can be a person that sees the good, in everything and everybody and in the end, the world turns on you.
",-1,1
"To- to do right by people, even if you realize that you're not d- being done fairly because my parents always told me that I would never be held responsible for how somebody treated me.
",-1,-1
"If you were to have the dream weekend, what would it be?
",-1,-1
"Um, my- my typical dream weekend would be  You know, just I wouldn't even say being in it- in a- in an exotic place.
",-1,1
"And be with the people who are like minded.
",-1,1
"An- an- and we've always been taught that you know, god should be the center.
",-1,1
"And that, um, it's, you know, good to be able to know god.
",-1,-1
"Um, now as far as me being in ministry, um, when I was younger I had some ideas about some things that I was going to do and how I was going to do it and I had, um,  a near death experience that allowed me to see, just how quickly you know, life could be gone.
",-1,-1
"And it allowed me to see that there may be some things that I had planned, that god did not plan.
",-1,-1
"I'm thinking about college a few months down the line and, um,  I was riding, uh, in a car uh, with my cousin and we crossed the- uh, a busy intersection, but of course we had looked to be sure that there was no onc- oncoming traffic.
",-1,-1
"Uh, wanna be a actor.
",-1,1
"You know, like, probably be like the next Eddie Murphy.
",-1,1
"And that's when you know living how to be homeless, and then not being homeless, you know, I pretty much know what they would go through.
",-1,1
"You know, cause not knowing what somebody may think, or be like oh, he homeless.
",-1,1
"Even though it has been a couple of talks about that in the news that some people fake to be homeless got a lot of money, and then got arrested for it.
",-1,-1
"Don't be stuck as no cashiers, no cook.
",-1,1
"You know, it's gonna be like, some struggles here and there.
",-1,-1
"Cause if it wasn't for her, to encourage me and pray and everything, I don't where I would be at.
",-1,-1
"Sometime, she can be a little bit nagging sometimes, or just always ask a lot of questions.
",-1,1
"Uh, how long you gonna be gone?
",-1,-1
"And knowing now, as I'm getting older, you know, I'm probably won't even be qualified anyway due the fact that, you know, if you got asthma, you automatic disqualified.
",-1,-1
"Even if just to be a garbage man or something.
",-1,1
"So, she wanted me cause she know I do great job with my results and stuff, so she figured, well since he don't wanna promote me for whatever reason that may be, maybe she'll promote me manager.
",-1,-1
"Cause I told my big boss, I said, well where do the safe normally be at at this particular store?
",-1,1
"I'm gonna be gone too.
",-1,-1
"I'll just have to lock them doors and- and- and be done with it and just take orders in drive through.
",-1,-1
"I'll know where I will be at.
",-1,-1
"But if it ain't for gas, it might just be for my stove.
",-1,-1
"I- uh- I- I- Look at your cousin dude just sit there just be quiet while you gave me that little speech.
",-1,1
"So, the second go around, I wasn't even sposta be at the bar.
",-1,1
"I was sposta still be at work closing.
",-1,1
"Cause they say she don't do it they were gonna close Taco Bell down for two weeks, or whatever case may be.
",-1,-1
"So I guess they tryna be like Florida I guess.
",-1,1
"Be done with it.
",-1,1
"Other then everybody's upbringings may be a little bit different, but everybody had the same chance that you have.
",-1,-1
"some may have a better chance because they parents may be little bit well off a little bit, or may had the extra means, but I wouldn't say I wouldn't have that deterred you from not getting to what you need to get to just because of that.
",-1,-1
"I said, even if I was to be like Chucky put the little base inside of you, I'm like she getting pregnant, I don't care.
",-1,1
"And then get twins, it'd be alright.
",-1,1
"What piece of advice would you be?
",-1,-1
"Don't give up cause it may seem tough now, you know, it may be like, you may experience like a little struggle, or you may feel like, oh this person's being hard on you, or or you feel like you can't make it.
",-1,-1
"Or, be in a better position than them.
",-1,1
"So now, since they all gone, I'm next in line to be the assistant.
",-1,-1
"He used to be a custodian at a university.
",-1,1
"I wor- I took a night job so that I could be home in the daytime, so I had him in the daytime.
",-1,-1
"And she had been my rock and so this was the opportunity for me to be her rock, so.
",-1,-1
"You know I close one, but another one came open because the lady she worked for, you know, she was ailing, my grandmother was ailing so she couldn't no longer be her caregiver to her, so.
",-1,-1
"I mean you have to understand, coming from a poor perspective and being able to do some things that you thought you'd never be able to do, travel, eat well, travel, and just have a good time.
",-1,-1
"She always wanted to be a part of it, so.
",-1,-1
"I wanted her to be able to see some of the world.
",-1,-1
"We got a lot to be thankful for.
",-1,1
"I don't want her to be the person that when people see her coming, they say, ugh.
",-1,-1
"I want her to be a person that people will like.
",-1,-1
"And be glad to have around.
",-1,1
"Um, so, I think she gonna be okay.
",-1,-1
"He's gonna be a handful.
",-1,1
"But he's gonna be all boy.
",-1,1
"He is as cute as he wants to be.
",-1,-1
"And he's a joy to be around.
",-1,1
"So, I see Danaya's persis- persistence as the same as Dishawn's when it comes to- It might be different interests, but their persistence is the same.
",-1,-1
"And we were in the room and all of a sudden this person come out the adjoining room, which I had no idea she was going to be there either.
",-1,-1
"I've been able to, uh, travel abroad I- I never thought I'd be able to do that.
",-1,-1
"And I'm driving so fast, but I'm- I'm trying to be aware of my driving so I won't wreck, you know, wreck, cause I needed to get there.
",-1,-1
"And- and be home, but at that point, when she returned home, I told god thank you.
",-1,1
"I- uh, maybe that could be a expression.
",-1,-1
"You're not gonna be any good to her if you don't settle down and- and take care of yourself, so you can get there.
",-1,-1
"He was absent father, but when he- Father got there, I mean when the kid got on top, the father wanted to be in the limelight, but he didn't forget where he came from.
",-1,-1
"Um, Just keeping 'em involved in something positive so they wouldn't be a product of the streets.
",-1,-1
"But if you don't want my help, don't waste my time because there- there might be that one child out there that really wants to change.
",-1,-1
"We have different programs they can be involved in.
",-1,1
"Oh, she had to be at least about seventy-five.
",-1,-1
"Last question, if you could leave a piece of advice, what would that be?
",-1,-1
"No, I- I couldn't be no maid, so I didn't do that.
",-1,1
"What was two dollars like today, what would that be?
",-1,-1
"So, what made say you know, what, I???????Ä?????????Ä?? go to I???????Ä?????????Ä?? go to beauty school and instead of working at the coffee shop, and you know that you weren't gonna be a maid.
",-1,-1
"It wasn't never fixed like it's supposed to be, cause old timey uh, carpenters, you know they didn't measure nothing.
",-1,-1
"Like, MLK, and how that seemed to be did it did you feel- did it feel different?
",-1,-1
"And stores, I remember Walgreens used to be downtown.
",-1,1
"And they tried to be nice, but you could tell, they- it hadn't got there.
",-1,-1
"Do remember like the first time that you went to a place that ha- used to be whites and colors and that you went in?
",-1,1
"And see, if you can't be nice, and I wasn't nice, you know, that nice.
",-1,1
"Just something you could do differently, what would it be?
",-1,-1
"I had surgery, and I couldn't lift and help with 'em, you know, getting 'em in and out the shampoo bowl and I sh- I had to stop that cause the Nurses are real lazy now, they ain't like they used to be.
",-1,1
"You said, I don't need to be on this boat.
",-1,-1
"It used to be a time t- twelve o'clock, we gonna turn that TV on you know, to watch l- Love of Life but now, it don't make no difference.
",-1,1
"Cause I know you don't be in the shop all day.
",-1,1
"But, it still ain't like it used to be, so I been just really going down, it look like ever since then, but other than that.
",-1,1
"Mm  No, I think it was just availability, I guess, would be the There you go.
",-1,-1
"So, I was uh, even though I could do the class work, they say by definition, in city school, you had to be six.
",-1,-1
"Be honest with you, I couldn't tell a difference.
",-1,1
"Cause I think it- it- it helped because you don't get kids come down right be - from a junior high setting to a high school settings.
",-1,-1
"Like, farmers and all, they would hire uh, someone like beacon uh i- be the, I guess, um  just like now with the Hispanics, you have someone that's actually the lead person, Mm-hm.
",-1,1
"So, she would- the people in the neighborhood that wanted to work, they would be more or less up under her umbrella.
",-1,1
"And once the 'bacca was cooked, then we would take the tobacco off the stick and put it in these big sheets and then it would go off to the warehouse to be sold.
",-1,-1
"The next level would be ripe, and then just like you- pruning I guess.
",-1,-1
"I started working Strickland- I would go to Strickland Cotton Mills, I?????ould work I would got to sch- wo- school all day long, I would get off and be a Strickland Cotton Mill at four o'clock and I would work a eight hour shift five or six days a week.
",-1,1
"He said, I already instructed these guys, whenever you might not be at your post, or whatever you're doing to help them, that I had already authorized you to get your school work every day while you're here at work.
",-1,-1
"And be separated from their family, their children, and that's something I didn't want, cause my daughter was just born.
",-1,1
"I guess it was more gen around to make sure you gonna be able to receive instructions and, um,  and move forward.
",-1,1
"So in my basic training- in fact, even in basic training,  I was able to um, I was given a position as the dorm chief that would be over all the s-  offic- over the troops, you know.
",-1,-1
"And we never seen those guys they w- they- we was- they would be with us during the day, in fact one of 'em was a, uh  the Hispanic guy was a um what we call disc jockeys back then.
",-1,1
"You decided to leave because you didn't want to be having this remote Right Mm.
",-1,-1
"N- the- shipping, receiving, and pulling the parts for the components to be built, mm-hm.
",-1,-1
"So, they have to be inspected and you got to make sure you got each boxes serialized separate to make sure you got the right batteries and all that stuff.
",-1,-1
"It's gonna be an amazing experience.
",-1,-1
"He saw the s- or he'd say, be careful who you let sit in that seat on the other side.
",-1,1
"You know d- t- it might be sk- crazy or strange, but,  when my mom died, it was I mean, that's expectations.
",-1,-1
"A- and And I th- guess wh- when you've been shut out so much of what you've perceived to be, um, validated as a people, um, you go from being kidnapped, to being, you know, bought over here and being enslaved and you being told you was free, but you're not free.
",-1,1
"I guess we had to be accepted.
",-1,-1
"The- e- what a- what a person s- what a person say, don't really have to make you- you don't have to be that.
",-1,-1
"It's not I bl- I- I- I had a concept that if anybody gonna be hurt, I can take it.
",-1,-1
"Let it be me.
",-1,1
"What would that piece of advice be and who would you leave it to?
",-1,-1
"Like if- if everybody applied that I think we would be in a very different situation.
",-1,1
"And so the house was nice three be - two bedroom.
",-1,1
"It's on- On the south side of town, by, they called it, the club used to be Fifth Inn, and uh, Lake Park Road.
",-1,-1
"Coming up in that area, where the tobacco warehouses used to be.
",-1,1
"I wanted to be the first black astronaut, but these women.
",-1,1
"So, I didn't like doing my arm, while I listened to him, so I wanted something easy with three little valve thinking that was gonna be easy to play.
",-1,-1
"But actually, I found out, that that's really what- that's about the hardest thing you can do, you know, cause you got your lips got to be in shape.
",-1,1
"I said, sir, uh, um, We just initiated him and we uh, we- we put him in- out there in the dumpster, to thought he was gonna be done got out by now.
",-1,-1
"Shoot, I don't know he might be still there, I don't know.
",-1,1
"Well, after I left high school, that's when I was trying to figure out what I wanted to be.
",-1,-1
"I know Tibisay told me say I'd be a interesting character this.
",-1,1
"We'll be back.
",-1,1
"We got to get some more parts, but uh, we'll be back again.
",-1,-1
"Couldn't be n- But she cussing us out.
",-1,-1
"And after all this breaking these bricks, you would think all the noise and the dust that I'm making s- if anything's under there, they'll be gone.
",-1,-1
"I told the people, I said look, I'll- I- I'll be back.
",-1,-1
"Go get- I went and got about five bombs and threw up under the house and told them I'd be back tomorrow.
",-1,1
"All these people spending all this money, and it- I know it's gonna be something extra.
",-1,-1
"Y- yo man, you gonna be together.
