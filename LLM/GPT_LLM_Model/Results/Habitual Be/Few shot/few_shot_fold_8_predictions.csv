",-1,-1
"And then when I got in and realized, oh, they're actually, like- this might actually be a good place.
",-1,-1
"And, I felt like I often had to do different things that I- I know- knew for sure that my other classmates didn't have to be concerned about.
",-1,-1
"And I think that really helped me to, um, understand, more about my identity and history and that it's- and to demand, like, justice and all these different things and that it's okay to- to be black on this campus and that, even though I know that for sure that are people that don't want me there, like I can actually excel here and get something, uh, from this experience.
",-1,-1

",-1,-1
"And that will be, like enough, um, and so, the whole time when I'm applying to these grad programs, I'm very skeptical that I'll get in I- I guess, but more so the fact that I didn't want to go to school for another, five s- five to seven years.
",-1,-1
"Um, and I knew that would bring a different set of challenges in that, I would be in this new place, where I didn't know anyone.
",-1,-1
"Um, cause I got this fellowship, and part of the fellowship was that you could possibly go earlier and like, get more acclimated, and stuff like that, and I chose to do that because I didn't know anyone in Michigan and so I thought this would be a good opportunity to meet other students of color or just like, minority students, before the semester.
",-1,-1
"And so when I would get the problem sets done, or get the homework done, they'd be like, how do you know how to do this?
",-1,1
"I think it can be - it- it's very easy to internalize that um, those feelings, um, in grad school, because a lot of times, people would personally attack your work and, like, the things you're interested in, especially if you're a person of color, studying communities of color, you know.
",-1,-1
"And it's like, no, like, you can actually do objective work and be black and like, that's fine.

",-1,-1
"So like, you know how to be a student, you know how to take classes, you know, you're amazing at that, you know, that's why you got into grad school.
",-1,1
"Like, I don't have classes when I'm expected to be working all the time.

",-1,-1
"And so,  I was like, I don't wanna be a professor.
",-1,-1
"So, I gotta be honest about that.
",-1,-1
"You know,  so, just like I said, the- the- the just mental capacity it takes, to just be challenged in every single way.
",-1,-1
"Um, but I definitely got this feeling that somehow, I should be disappointed in myself, because I didn't go to academia.
",-1,-1
"Um, and it's also hard, because people- when I come home, people expect me to be the same person, talk the same way, talk about the same things.
",-1,1
"No, I think that is gonna be really good.
",-1,-1
"I don't want you to be interrupted.

"uh, it took a while to find people who I think like, wanted to be friend and by tenth grade, I think maybe I found them.

",-1,-1
"That would be silly.
",-1,-1
"So it's just like, I- I- even though, you would think that would limit you, And- and I guess it does, but I always knew I couldn't be like a Victoria Secret model.
",-1,-1
"Like, I'm never gonna be on- on a runway on television.
",-1,-1
"But, I don't know, natural hair comes in a lot of different- I- it took me a long time to realize that natural hair can be straight if that's your texture.
",-1,-1
"And also I thought it would be really- I wanted to do it, cause I hadn't done- I hadn't worked with, like uh, a staff that- like a staff of color in while on a photoshoot or anything.
",-1,-1
"And I was like, this might be fun.
",-1,-1
"But this one that was like specifically actually for, like it was supposed to uplift and be positive.
",-1,-1
"She might see one person who she identifies with and that might be me.
",-1,-1
"Like, letting me be that.
",-1,1
"Like if they need to be inclusive, then if I'm included, I think it sets them at ease.

",-1,-1
"And- and my boss will be like, I didn't know you were black.
",-1,1
"Like, that I- I feel like I almost shouldn't be hearing.
",-1,-1
"Or be accomplished .
",-1,1
"I was gonna say what would it be for?
",-1,-1
"And I would be really happy doing it.
",-1,-1
"Like, I'm still not gonna kick you out, but if you are, I'm gonna try to be extra supportive of that.
",-1,-1
"And it's gonna be like- No.
",-1,-1
"I'm gonna be twenty-seven and I don't really do anything.
",-1,-1
"On the flip side though, I could host something and it would probably be really fun.
",-1,-1
"I may find a way to use it, but I just like really, just wanna be happy.
",-1,-1
"And do you have like an ideal school, or place even that you would like to be like Chicago, or I don't know, inaudible.
",-1,-1
"I wanna be there.
",-1,1
"And- and then- and then when I realized like, black people can be British too Mm-hm.
",-1,1
"It just seems like, some of the things that we worry about here, might not be things that people worry about over there.
",-1,-1
"I almost feel like I'm late for an appointment because like I should be somewhere else.
",-1,-1
"I don't- I don't think it's necessarily good to be selfless at all.
",-1,-1
"I just happened to be here.
",-1,1
"I mean you're right, but I tried to keep that goal in mind and I tried to think that even if I got my heart broken, I still kno- at least know that I can- I can try to be with someone without manipulation, or riding on the coat tails of something else, or like- Mm.
",-1,-1
"Like, I think it's gonna be a- a lot easier for me.
",-1,-1
"I could be a certain kind of girl I guess.
",-1,-1
"And it felt good not to be manipulative, or like, just get what I want, any other way, other than honesty.
",-1,-1
"it'll be okay.
",-1,1
"It took me until twenty-five to realize that, cause I was like, ew what the fuck, who wants to be here.
",-1,-1
"like part of the reason why I haven't left is because I've never felt like I've been able to save up enough money to be okay, somewhere else.
",-1,1
"Um, without being in school or just in any case even if I were in school, nobody wants to go somewhere and be broke.
",-1,1
"And it doesn't have to be a struggle.
",-1,-1
"Doesn't have to be uncomfortable.
",-1,-1
"uh, if I could just never think about it until the day I die, I'd be perfectly happy.
",-1,-1
"And that's where I would ideally want to be, but yeah I like this area.
",-1,-1
"Um,  And I guess my last question would be, do you feel like, um, people in Rochester, in all your travels I guess, do you feel like people in Rochester have an accent?
",-1,-1
"And like, put your voice up there, I don't think that people would automatically just be like, she's from Rochester, you know.
",-1,-1
"Yeah, I'll be back tomorrow.
",-1,-1
"No matter where I go, like I don't want people to ever be able to pinpoint that.
",-1,-1
"And I wanted to like have certain things be true despite what people would think about the way that I look.
",-1,1
"I just wanna know about what you perceive Rochester to be, what it was like to grow up here, where you went to school, what you wanna do next, just those sorts of questions.
",-1,-1
"So instead of allowing my mom to be a mom, everybody else in the family, felt like they wanted to raise him.
",-1,-1
"Like I remember just being that kid that's just like, hey, I wanna be friends with everybody, and- and doing that, and really like understanding like I don't understand why this person is being mean to me right now, but I don't like this feeling, so I kind of have to you know, protect myself.
",-1,-1
"Oh, you can't watch TV even though you finished your homework, cause J.R. didn't finish his homework, and he's gonna be distra- Like, it was just a lot of different rules, and a lot of different living situations that I didn't have to live with- like, never had to deal with.
",-1,-1
"And now mind you, my aunt's kids be fine.
",-1,1
"Like, so, from that- that I can say, if I didn't have that, I don't really know where I would be right now.
",-1,-1
"Cause like you look at it, and it's just like,  this could be so much better.
",-1,-1
"Now mind you, can't possibly be a weed smell because my roommate's at work.
",-1,-1
"And  we don't wanna be here, honestly.
",-1,-1
"I could say like, living in all these different places in Rochester, you kind of really- Rochester seems divided, or it's- seems like it's being portrayed to be divided, but really, everybody knows somebody in some type of way.
",-1,-1
"I wanna say that was a mistake, but seeing as how my life turned out, can't be a mistake.
",-1,-1
"And the idea was you would want the students to be juniors.
",-1,1
"And that, that right there made me realize- I'm like oh,  like, you can be book smart, but like, there's a different type of something out here, that you definitely need in life.
",-1,-1
"I'm like, you're gonna be my advisor?
",-1,-1
"Yeah I'll be your advisor.
",-1,-1
"I'm like hey, be honest with you man, from the hood.
",-1,1
"He's like, you know what , I think you might be onto something, young man.

"I remember like mid-town downtown used to be booming.
",-1,1
"McCurdy's, you had Sibley's like,  it was like the place to be.
",-1,-1
"um, I remember in that phase, that was a phase where I was like, no, I don't wanna be here.
",-1,-1
"whether it be music recording, poetry, dance, singing, visual arts, screen printing, all that type of stuff.
",-1,1
"Um, a lot of people that are doing a lot of different stuff in the community, I'd be like, oh yeah I know so and so from the Bert.
",-1,1
"So right now that like- the people who are like, before me in like that- I would say like our age, wa- would be like, thirty, thirty-five-ish area.
",-1,-1
"Yo, I wanna be the one to make it out.
",-1,1
"I guess, I would say my favorite show would be, uh, the community experience that I put on last year with our executive director.
",-1,-1
"Like- like you can hear somebody from the city and be like, okay yeah, they're from the city.
",-1,1
"Cause I get people that, um, come from- from like out of town, they'll be like, yo what's up with the accent?
",-1,1
"Like you hear- you can hear- in New York City you can hear a Bronx accent be like, okay.
",-1,1
"So if that means consciously having to do the complete opposite, of what you're talking about, just so I could be like ha ha, you can't say that because I'm not that, then, that's what I'm gonna do.
",-1,-1
"Like, it's hard, like, it's hard to be positive.
",-1,-1
"I mean, I guess it's- I mean, every city has a ugly side, but it still doesn't deter me from really wanting my city to be prosperous and really understanding that like, again, so much potential.
",-1,-1
"More work to be done.

",-1,-1
"I'm just like, yo, this what I should be doing.
",-1,-1
"It could be some club stuff, some party stuff, some love stuff, some hate stuff, anger stuff.
",-1,-1
"You know what I mean, like I'm a human like, I- I'm'a be everything.
",-1,1
"For a artist to be like one thing is just like, kind of like, faking the funk, you know what I mean.

",-1,-1
"It wouldn't be like Action Bronson, and Dave East, um, even ASAP like, you know what I mean.

",-1,-1
"It's really deep, but yeah, that- the- where- where I'm living at, it really- this one is really reminding me of where I used to be on Fabienne m- where I- where I was growing up.

"You know, things like that, like I want to be kind of like how- how- Chance the Rapper and Kendrick Lamar and J. Cole, how they present their messages.
",-1,-1
"You won't be happy until you love what you got.
",-1,-1
"Because there's always gonna be something greater.
",-1,1
"There's gonna be a house bigger than yours.
",-1,1
"There's always gonna be a woman that's badder than the one you got.
",-1,1
"It's always gonna be somebody with more money than you.
",-1,1
"If I can just speak for them I may be able to push someone enough to for they can follow they dream the way they need to.
",-1,-1
"Like I have to put all of that in perspective because there's gonna be one day that I'm gonna have to explain that, you know?
",-1,-1
"Explain what- Like, perfect example, if I wanted to make a song about the neighborhood and what the neighborhood should be, I'm gonna use references on how I grew up, you know what I'm saying?
",-1,-1
"So I ca- I get it a little bit, but I just want the support factor to be there again.
",-1,-1
"You know, and, with the kickball things that's happening right now, that is also helping the community cause it's- you know, it used to be like a east side west side type of war for some reason, and it's been going on ever since my dad was a kid.
",-1,-1
"That's the epitome of what support supposed to be.
",-1,-1
"I ca- I can be Geechee.
",-1,1
"I sound New York when I rap, but I can be Geechee.
",-1,1
"The way they talk, I mean, they may talk fast or words may be s- s- words may sound connected to each other when they not, or-  or they just, you know, got a slight mumble with it.
",-1,-1
"It's like you're trying to be like them.
",-1,-1
"Nathaniel- Nathaniel was, uh- isn't that- Maressa School is on Wynona Jenilee Way, used to be Jenilee.
",-1,-1
"Well, you know, I- you know I- I- I think that someone- someone apparently back in the sixties was somewhat forward looking to the degree that they were able to map out like a neighborhood that would be close to the center of the city, and- you know, and- you know like an easy walk or an easy bike ride, you know, to downtown work, and, you know, businesses, and- and government offices, and they bought up a bunch of property.
",-1,-1
"So, you know, you know, people were coming back into the city, and they were like scoping out neighborhoods that would be convenient to their office locations.
",-1,-1
"Um,    you know, sneaking out and like wanting to, you know, at night, be like- seek out that- those sce- you know, like those scenes.
",-1,1
"And that began to bother me, um, cause I'm like, whose choice is it to be urban, you know?
",-1,-1
"It's your choice to be urban, you- you know, like Right.
",-1,1
"But my- my perspective would be a little different.
",-1,-1
"urban by- you know, we live here because we wanna be here.
",-1,1
"That kind of sentiment came from is- is that they, um, th- you know, they wanted to- they wanted the neighborhood to be, um, inte- integrated, and like, you know, like, lots of different people living.
",-1,-1
"Um, let's see, what else was I gon- oh, I wanted to ask about what you thought about U of R's sort of role in- in trying to create this, um, college town for students, and how you think it might be affecting the neighborhood.
",-1,-1
"If it were moved to College Town, it would not- you know, it wouldn't be for those neighbors.
",-1,-1
"It would be for these students who are now coming and taking up space in this neighborhood.
",-1,-1
"And a- I remember, you know, on a daily basis driving, um, through Plymouth, and, um, I was shocked to see-  cause I, you know, assumed that housing for the U of R in that space w- would probably be pretty white, um, and it's still shocking.
",-1,-1
"Especially, you know, when I say targets, it's like, well if you can afford to live in like, you know, this expensive housing, like you might be someone that I want,  you know.
",-1,-1
"I mean, before the- I'm- I'm- before Boulder was there it used to be a drug store on the corner of Brooks and Genesee.
",-1,-1
"this Jewish community, this rabbi, all of a sudden, he's interested in the building, and it has to be that building, right.
",-1,1
"It has to be this building.
",-1,-1
"I mean it's just- it's just a- y- you know, l- you know, like these people are gonna be walking down the street, a- and they're gonna d- you know, you know, somebody's- somebody's gonna get hurt, right.
",-1,1
"I mean, this is- this is not- this not working out the way that- I mean that whole- that building where the coffee shop is now, that whole- that was supposed to be like U of R office space.
",-1,-1
"the d- the- the first floor was supposed to be like restaurants and coffee shop, and, you know a- or, you know, you know, places.
",-1,1
"And in spite of that, it- it doesn't seem to be working.
",-1,-1
"Breakers would be doing windmills when you're like, coming out of the bathroom door.
",-1,-1
"Like the places where we can be creative and like share our arts, enjoy our arts, you know.
",-1,1
"Um,  and at the same time, it's like there used to be, um, you know, like space for the up and coming.
",-1,-1
"And it would be like a two day, you know, like a f- all weekend thing.
",-1,-1
"Um, and then w- when like music that could be like inspirational and like, uh, you know positive f- and uplifting to us, people don't even want it for free.
",-1,-1
"I will be attending that, um, DMX, Uncle Luke, Juvenile, um, which is like the r- most ratchet mu- but I mean I love that shit.
",-1,-1
"You know, like, but at the same time, I also can be conscious like this is horrendous.
",-1,1
"And we do that with him, but the- the imagination o- of children is really not sparked like it used to be like when, you know, I didn't have a box in front of me that I could play with.
",-1,-1
"Um, w- in the fourth grade, I had a truant officer because I refused- so I- I was in- this is also gonna be a very convoluted story, but, um, so first, second, and third grade, I was in, um, a program where we were, you know I was with the same group of kids for three years.
",-1,1
"Um, you know, I- I had to be dragged into school on many occasions.
",-1,-1
"I- my parents made too much for me to be, um, EOP.
",-1,-1
"I had talked to somebody, a teacher who used to be a dental hygienist, and I was like, yeah I'm just gonna become a dental hygienist.
",-1,-1
"You don't wanna be in people's mouths , like you're not gonna do it.
",-1,1
"W- we used to be educated by our own people.
",-1,1
"Um, you know, if there- it was like ha- a lot of diabetes, we would like focus on sugars, and you know, like- but that was really nice to be able to offer this program, um, and like, you know, hopefully have people make small changes, um, to help their health.
",-1,-1
"Like I, um- it looks very different in different positions, and I don't know like what, you know, the end goal for me is gonna be.
",-1,-1
"Um, but I- I like to be able to educate people, um, i- and expand people's, um, understanding of things that they may not have access to.
",-1,-1
"You know, like this is just their life, and, you know, I wouldn't want somebody- I wouldn't want that to be it for me, so that's what I- that's what I try to do.
",-1,-1
"For me, I like to be able to normalize things that seem very taboo, uh, to people.
",-1,-1
"It was like a culture shock kind of to be around all of these kids who, they grew up together, they've been together since kindergarten.
",-1,-1
"It's nice to be around family Mm-hm.
",-1,-1
"And I was surprised for the area, but it was enough minority teachers where you would be able to sit in a class and see somebody that looked like you.
",-1,1
"The one thing- yeah- yeah, I notice like they expected you to be so street and so hood, and I'm like w- what the hell you talking about.
",-1,-1
"And then like, because I did so many activities, they would come over our house and be like, oh my god this house is so nice.
",-1,1
"And they would be shocked because a lot of white kids weren't used to seeing black people with money or black people that had a little bit of anything.
",-1,1
"That's really good to be in sort of- or feel like you're in an environment that's like Mm-hm.
",-1,-1
"I wanted the- be around black people, black minori- like people learning and bettering themselves.
",-1,1
"And then, um, just the experience of being around other people, be it black, white, whatever, who take their education seriously because a lot of people don't.
",-1,1
"Right, but EOP, that whole experience is weird, and then, being expected to be in it.
",-1,-1
"So my academic advisor told me that you could still be a English major and work- he said you can do more with a English degree than you can a journalism degree.
",-1,-1
"I wanted to be a writer.
",-1,-1
"They can be what, twenty-one or twenty-two?
",-1,-1
"Where are you gonna be going?
",-1,-1
"Yeah, I'm-  I'm doing- Because I feel like I'm about to be thirty-two and had I known all of this stuff about all these different programs and stuff, I probably woulda chose a different career path.
",-1,-1
"And my sister, she was supposed to be a lawyer.
",-1,-1
"Yeah, so it's been- mm, it's just, you live and you learn, but I always thought like- you know, you see yourself when you grow up, I always thought I was gonna be a teacher until I experienced it.
",-1,1
"You used to be able to borrow how much you wanted and she was- wasn't working that- all the time, so she would borrow enough to pay her rent up because she lived off campus and all that, but that comes back to haunt you, so.
",-1,1
"I was gonna ask, like, are you thinking of keeping her through til- Yeah, she won't be there for long.
",-1,-1
"But I think after fifth grade, she might be, um, done at Jerick.
",-1,-1
"I went to school to be a teacher.
",-1,-1
"And I understand it might be hard.
",-1,-1
"So I don't think she will be th- Because I've gone to city schools, private schools, and suburban schools, so I know the difference.
",-1,-1
"Or I'm tryna be in the suburbs somewhere because I don't do urban suburban.
",-1,-1
"And I feel like if you are an involved parent with your kid's education, they're gonna be successful wherever they are.
",-1,-1
"It was a trip, like m- grown- grown boys used to be buying lunch all the time.
",-1,1
"Like, let these kids be kids for a little while longer.
",-1,1
"It- it really is, and it's gotta be overwhelming Mm.
",-1,-1
"But it used to be different here.
",-1,1
"Mayb- I don't know, because for it to be diverse, I mean yes our mayor is black, but I kind of think that was happenstance, cause I'd never heard of her until she was running for mayor.
",-1,-1
"We have minorities in powerful positions, but it's like I don't know- I didn't know who they were, or they weren't advocating or making theirself be known in the black community until it was time to vote.
",-1,1
"Oh yeah it is, okay, be careful, have a nice- Like, I don't- I've never had- never had a negative experience.
",-1,1
"My last name happens to be Kemper, but my mother's, their last name is notorious in Rochester for it.
",-1,1
"Yeah, that would be interesting.
",-1,-1
"Yeah and they'd be like, They definitely talk funny and, um- we thought y'all was from the South.
",-1,1
"Yeah I would like- that would be interesting because I think we talk like the people on TV.
",-1,-1
"So that would be interesting to know Mm-hm.
",-1,-1
"I'd love for businesses to be in the city.
",-1,1
"And so, this whole push for safer spaces and building, you know, this whole perception that you're in the city, the U of R, but it might not be safe and so they're taking up real estate that is exclusive to the folks that they're catering to.
",-1,-1
"Um,  who were very angry, who felt like we were taking their jobs, mainly me, um, and it was a hostile environment, where people felt free to speak their minds and you needed to depend on them to teach you in order to be successful.
",-1,-1
"And- and how much a person has to put up with in order to be successful in their role.
",-1,-1
"And that was the best decision, I ever made, um, because I probably would have been postal or something if I stayed at- it- I can't even imagine what my life would be if I was still at Tawonda.
",-1,-1
"I don't ever wanna be in a place where it's acceptable to like, put your confederate flag outside, or to do- you know what Yeah.
",-1,-1
"You know what I mean, like, I- I don't want it to be s- acceptable just to say how you feel, wherever, whenever, walk, or- you know.
",-1,-1
"And so I don't wanna be in that type of environment.
",-1,-1
"And I think it's gonna be giving back.
",-1,-1
"except at our family picnic, or-  And then there you might be one of  right?
",-1,1
"And so, out of curiosity, would like, for example, maybe the vogue, uh, the voguing of it, be something that happens more in a black space as opposed to- Mm-hm It's one hundred percent.
",-1,1
"Um, you can't really relax, um, but I obviously don't wanna be in farmland, you know.
",-1,-1
"You know, I can't- this is a personal one, um, I mean we still live in- I always joke about if we didn't have New York City we'd be a red state.
",-1,-1
"you could be driving into the South.
",-1,1
"And how- you know, and she's like, how could somebody be afraid of him?
",-1,-1
"Um, and so, you start to, you know, when you see a police officer kill someone on tape, and it looks wrong, there has to be a reason for it.
",-1,-1
"You know, and I s- I think there are a lot of folks who are in this middle ground right now, who can't really explain what's going on, but it can't be that.
",-1,-1
"I do think- I mean you think about, um, social media and who all the trolls are, they tend to be young white guys, computer geeks Mm-hm.
",-1,-1
"Um, but I do think for the most part- You know, there used to be an entire generation of folks who all believed this stuff.
",-1,-1
"and- and I- after leaving Kirt I- you know, there was one incident, where that happened at my job and I just t- told myself I would never be in that situation again, cause I was so, it was so bad.
",-1,1
"I know what you have to be feeling.
",-1,-1
"Um, but I don't know if I'd be able to get another job.
",-1,-1
"I'm not in a space to be there.
",-1,-1
"You know, whatever it might be, we have folks who are taking a stand and saying, listen, this isn't right, we need to do something.
",-1,-1
"She says, o- w- as soon as I get on the phone with my family, or she said we can be driving to their house, and my- my language changes.
",-1,-1
"But it was really, like I s- we all- many of us went to that high school from seventh to twelfth grade, and I believe when we got to ninth grade, there was, um, sort of, uh, a reorganization of the city prop- uh, the city schools, and Vanny was threatened to be closed down as a high school.
",-1,-1
"And, as appealing as after school and extracurricular activities were, I wanted to be around my grandma, and come back home.
",-1,-1
"I wanted to go home and be home with my grandma.
",-1,-1
"I tease him that he should have, uh, when I first met him, I thought his family was West Indian cause, you know, I wasn't sophisticated enough to be able to tell dialects at that time, and I only knew Florida and Georgia, and that's a very different sounding, um, tone.
",-1,-1
"You said I had to be a high school graduate.
",-1,-1
"I'll be eighteen before the program finishes.
",-1,-1
"I would be leaning on the clients, cracking jokes.
",-1,1
"And I wasn't really- it was just something so I wouldn't be laying around the house.
",-1,-1
"And I always made the joke when I was a child that I would make- I would be an English teacher or a social worker, and I woulda made twenty thousand a year.
",-1,1
"But not one of them said- except for one crazy lady who was mad because I wouldn't be her friend, I had to report her.
",-1,-1
"You know, so I knew where I was gonna be at.
",-1,-1
"Like I want you to be observant in every area of your life.
",-1,1
"It's g- it's p- should be about maybe seven minutes long.
",-1,-1
"But I think that, um, there are a lot of people who just write in vacuums, and- and sometimes, um, because people don't have- there's a lot of academic bashing that, oh, you have to be like a guerrilla writer.
",-1,-1
"So when I go to some of this stuff I'm like, oh, I hear you cause it's, you know finesse this thing, and it could be a little bit- little bit on a higher level.
",-1,-1
"We'd be at the Eastman Theatre looking at Paddington the bear.
",-1,1
"Charter schools can't be -   I c- I could cry about it.
",-1,-1
"whether or not you, uh perceive Rochester to be a demographically  Diverse?
",-1,-1
"So, um, I've never heard that for me particularly, but I've heard- in particular, but I've heard other people, and I'm like, oh, that must be what we sound like to other people, but there's a- that- that milk  or milk- I'm like, what?
",-1,-1
"You don't have to be noticed or anything, but just because you could.
",-1,-1
"He'll be seventy-four.
",-1,-1
"I am teaching tenth gr- I'll be starting teaching tenth grade global studies at Ciaira Oh cool.
",-1,-1
"And, so you have to um, be presentable when you go in because you don't know who you will come across.
",-1,-1
"Because, one, they have to be and- and, two, I think they're just they don't care as much.
",-1,1
"But, two years ago, and then this past year, which was a very light winter, there was still concern that we may not be able to move remove snow.
",-1,-1
"I'm thinking w- the area that we're living in, how is our- our sp- what is going on with our government spending that something as crucial as snow removal for us to be functioning for a good, especially from say, Mm-hm.
",-1,-1
"N- That shouldn't be a negotiation.
",-1,-1
"That should be handled.
",-1,-1
"both sides would be able to compromise to say, alright you know what?
",-1,1
"Whatever their reason may be.
",-1,-1
"And, I'm like, you're gonna be telling kids, you need to get up at five maybe four-thirty in the morning to catch a bus to get to school on time.
",-1,-1
"Where there's a Wegmans Take that train in for thirty minutes, be dropped off right in front of the stadium do whatever you want around the stadium.
",-1,1
"That place is teeming with teenagers because they're trying to be cool and get into the city.
",-1,1
"But it's- it's if you look at where it is, you're not too far from an expressway, so you can hop into the city, park, be cool, and then hop out.
",-1,-1
"Also, you're forced to address words may be a little more challenging in pronuncia- pronun- pronunciation.
",-1,-1
"Um, so then I had to start doing uh, so, I started reading a lot more stuff that for me to be entertained by it, I had to read out loud to myself.
",-1,-1
"And you'll be used to them as well.
",-1,1
"I think also, part of what influenced my language is I was a lot of my friends were, would be classified as gifted and talented.
",-1,1
"However I need it to be, but you know the basic story.
",-1,-1
"These are kids that should be in the fifth, sixth grade, but we put them in the fourth and third grade when they move here.
",-1,-1
"I- one of 'em well she's U of R. She's going to be a doctor, and the other two are engineers.
",-1,-1
"to be a vendor.
",-1,-1
"Somebody just has to be - has to get to the root cause, what's going on.
",-1,-1
"You know, I wanna be able to make a decent salary, and there's no guarantee staying here you're gonna do that.
",-1,-1
"Um, oh, I know what I could ask you that would be good, um, if you remember any of the stories, I guess, from your parents about them first coming to Rochester, Mm-hm.
",-1,-1
"would be a good- Yeah, she's good.
",-1,-1
"still think there are- seem to be things.
",-1,-1
"and who they grew up with, then it's gonna be different.
",-1,-1
"I definitely remember- I could be - remember like being so excited so.
",-1,-1
"You know, Christmas time, it still isn't, you know, as big as it used to be.
",-1,-1
"You can't just stay in the house be afraid to do things, you know, Yeah.
",-1,1
"And sometimes, as I got, you know, more comfortable with her working, she would let me go to the movie, but it used to be I had chores.
",-1,1
"I said, you must, uh, be the Srinivas from Theophilus.
",-1,-1
"Right past Biran Avenue this big beautiful brick house, and it used to be a church next door, but they tore the church down.
",-1,-1
"They used to be on Clifford Avenue Mm.
",-1,1
"That woulda been such a thrill to be there, and I missed it.
",-1,-1
"It might be Water Street.
",-1,-1
"And we would sit out there all the time hoping this would be the night they'd call us in again.
",-1,1
"But I had to d- of course I had to be home at a certain time.
