"Uh, misusage of funds, I mean any kind of money that came through was always a big scandal about that, and it's basically I just don't think that- It's- there's one woman that's on the town council that really pushes and drives for Princeville to be good but they don't give her her credit.

"But something needs to be done.
",-1,-1
"I don't think we get enough uh, publicity because if it's the first black charter town, seems like somebody would be tryna do something to try to restore all the stuff and but you don't see that.
",-1,-1
"I think with growing up in Princeville, Princeville should be like a foot stool for- for where you need to go.
",-1,-1
"Cause with the way everything is, it should make you want to be somewhere better.
",-1,-1
"That's um, from- It used to be from fourth- fourth and fifth grade.
",-1,1
"But then they got- At Princeville, they used to be from pre K to third, but they got pre K to fourth right there too, so it's kind of- Yeah, however they do it.

",-1,1
"I'm a funny guy when I want to be.
",-1,1
"Inaudible When I want to be.
",-1,1
"And that's the way you got to be though.
",-1,1
"That's- that's- in it- that's like- You know, you- you hang out, you do what you got to do, but when you go to work, you got to be business minded.
",-1,-1
"You know, so I mean it could be a lot of work.
",-1,-1
"And you know, the phone box used to be on the ground in a box.
",-1,1
"You know, because you got people that w- be - and grants and money that's out there that you can get by being the oldest black town that- which, you know, by it was flooded.
",-1,-1
"You know, just got to be willing to go out there and get it.

",-1,-1
"You know, it's- I mean, shouldn't no town have problems with animosity against each other, but it seem like they should be together if it's them against Rocky Mount or something.
",-1,1
"But for them to be - What?
",-1,-1
"Yeah, you got a couple guys that you know, might be finished school that still act what I say childish.
",-1,1
"Cause I want to be able walk anywhere and ain't got to watch my back.
",-1,-1
"Ed, might be a couple, and we can go anywhere we wanna go and don't have no problem.
",-1,1
"You know, so- You know I- I compared it to back in the- in the slavery days, you know, where people used to be out in the field picking 'bacca And I told 'em- I just had a conversation with a guy the other day.
",-1,1
"It can't be.
",-1,-1
"I understand why it got to be this way, but it's backwards.
",-1,-1
"So by the time she got off work, there was about a hour or so before it got dark and we had to be back in the house so I found that in Princeville I can say we became close because we was like set apart from other families.
",-1,1
"But uh, I can say that Princeville was a- was a start, and- But my mom always told us to si- stick together, and you know, be concerned about one another.
",-1,1
"Like I- As I said before, my mama was very strict on us, and the people in the street thought my mom was mean, but today we appreciate it because none of us to God be the Glory th- not on drugs or never- My mom had seven kids, never been in jail, so we count that a blessing.

",-1,-1
"In raising my kids, m- a lot of my sisters and brother are not in church, and I al- I always wanted to be the one that  um, made a difference in their lives.
",-1,1
"So it was like, um, I would pray to God and ask God to bless 'em and- and- and um, let them be saved, and God told me to walk more clearly before them.
",-1,1
"I place you here in this family to walk more clearly, and so I was the one that always obeyed- You know, they would come to be about anything.
",-1,1
"Cause my nieces and nephews, I- I wanted them to be raised like we was raised.
",-1,1
"So I feel it in my heart that God had chosen me to move my family in the realm that he wanted them to be in, so.
",-1,1
"W- He's- he's a person that would help you but in Princeville, he had a bad name because when people are not where they supposed to be, then they label you.
",-1,-1
"That's because that's not where they supposed to be.

",-1,-1
"So I said, you know, they- they're not here because they wanna be here.
",-1,-1
"So the adults had to get up- They have to be to work at eight o'clock, they had to get up at four to go on and um, get their breakfast and- and get their clothing and stuff and get out of the way for the crew for six o'clock.
",-1,1
"They had to go- There was another crew that got up at six that had to be at work at eight.
",-1,-1
"Um, yeah, the- Uh, I guess it would be somewhere around the sixties.
",-1,-1
"And, uh-  and your fingers would be hurting from shelling so many peanuts.
",-1,1
"And I used to s- say, well, if this supposed to be sharecropping, why are we doing all the work?
",-1,1
"i- Well, it's supposed be sharecroppers, right?
",-1,-1
"Uh, Well like I said, any time work have to be done on the farm we had to stay out.
",-1,-1
"And, uh, a lot of time when they pull you out from school, you you have to be up by five, five thirty.
",-1,-1
"And a- so you that you could be in the field by six.
",-1,-1
"If I was going to school, we have to, uh, um, get up, be on the bus by seven, yeah, about seven.
",-1,-1
"And, um, then at, uh, seven- sixteen, I could be about seventeen then, I started driving a bus.
",-1,-1
"So next time, be a lot better  I started driving a school bus, uh-huh.
",-1,-1
"Um, and it was good to see some- you know, the black store, they moving up, you know, wanting to be successful.
",-1,1
"And, uh, Um, because it was a- a large market, and- and I felt like if one thing didn't do for me, I could find something else to do, uh, in another- in- in the same field but doing something different in the same field I took up because I had really wanted to be a CPA.
",-1,-1
"And eighty-six and, um, the people here is, um- is real nice, um, We've been- I moved from Tarboro the mobile park that I was talking about, and, uh, into a Alright and then,  uh, from First Street on back up, um, it would be on the right side, found on the right side of- of  Boulevard and, um, then I got everything on the right side on Mutual Boulevard, and part of Southern Terrace.
",-1,1
"Yeah, the high school they was at, uh, Pattillo, so they would be in Tarboro.
",-1,-1
"Because they- they supposed be, um, n- um, builded like, uh, the, uh, historical society do.
",-1,1
"And, um, uh, historic- they supposed to be, um, help preserving that church because of it age.
",-1,1
"Um,  then my, uh, granddaddy's he used to, uh, own a barbershop, right be - next to it to, um, the church, that I'm a member of in Speed.
",-1,1
"So I said, see now it's working matter how- cause I say- my car, I'm gonna have to get out, and- So I'm'a be able to work, so I say, I better- I'll go to my mom and daddy house.
",-1,-1
"You know, cause we thought all the water, you know, it- it had stopped raining, because it didn't appear to be no- no more rain.
",-1,-1
"And like I said, oh that gonna be gone, you know, after a while.
",-1,-1
"The- it's a flood coming in Princeville, and they don't know how deep it gonna be.
",-1,-1
"I'll be scared of what- you know, what somebody gonna say.
",-1,-1
"I just might be scared that they ask the question, so I just basically just sit back.
",-1,-1
"Fourth grade would- starts- Had to be like the- When you start- But think it was like second grade.
",-1,-1
"Every- every now and then, he'll get in his mood though, he'll- we'll be sitting down.
",-1,1
"Then, like I said, get a little attitude, then I say he- well he gonna be on my back anyway.
",-1,-1
"Let me give him something to be on my back for.
",-1,-1
"That was you go in- Think we were going in like- I think you had be in like, three o'clock.
",-1,-1
"That's what the name used to be is- Yeah.
",-1,1
"So I had to be - How long you been here?
",-1,-1
"You know, riding by some day, they out here, know, Might be cooking out.
",-1,1
"And the car rolled though- Cause he- Cause when- how you going on the road, you sposta be going straight.
",-1,-1
"Every now and then though, a little- little grass fire you know, might be alright, but just think about somebody house catching on fire, yeah.
",-1,1
"Then especially when I had one that come up to me and he was like, I want to be a fireman.
",-1,-1
"You know, I know there gonna be some things that you gonna have a problem with, you know, cause I mean I looked at some of the- some of the stuff they doing now.
",-1,-1
"And least for both of us to be sitting there I got- done got a spanking for something you done did.
",-1,-1
"Uh, that- other than that used to be the grocery store here at- right here at- right beside the fire station sort of?
",-1,1
"And it used to be a dance club  on what- on two fifty eight.
",-1,1
"Um, not directly but I felt- that's my own personal feelings of what I could see what would just be here say because it could have been my thoughts.
",-1,-1
"Whether you stayed in Tarboro or Princeville, you all connected be at the same school.
",-1,1
"You know, I said one day I either wanna be a fireman or a police officer.
",-1,-1
"You know, so I said well, uh, I could be a part of that, you know .
",-1,-1
"I don't remember any other flood other than just low level floods, you know, where you could walk in it, where it would be sometime like almost knee high, but as far as evacuating the whole town, I don't know more- I don't think we had a lot of those type floods.
",-1,-1
"And I told 'em they could go ahead on and leave, thinking that we was gonna be back in a couple of hours.
",-1,-1
"You know, so we realized then that we was um, not gonna be coming back, you know, for awhile.
",-1,-1
"You know, so if they see the water, Gonna be  in danger.
",-1,-1
"We had quite a few stay a little too long and they had to be rescued by uh, Army helicopter.
",-1,-1
"Just guessing between the house and the mailbox, using the mailbox as a guide and knowing where the road sposta be.
",-1,1
"Yeah guessing where the road should be.
",-1,1
"After uh, notifying the fire marshal, uh, he said that help was coming but it was gonna be several hours getting here with the um, National Guard, I guess.
",-1,-1
"You know, I think that would be the key.
",-1,-1
"Yeah, you know, the risk will still be there, but it just old conveniency.
",-1,1
"And I don't know if that's mental or what but um, if I weren't from Princeville and visit here I'll be more appreciative that fact that I'm here in the- in the oldest town in America- black town and so you know but to know that now I grew up in this area and I'm part of this area now I appreciate it even more.
",-1,-1
"You know, we wanna be able to run our own town and handle our own business like that.
",-1,1
"You know, but um, you either wanna be a part of the team, or you just wait for the team.
",-1,1
"The problem must be removed.
",-1,-1
"You know, but sometime when your hands are tied, based on finances or based on uh, situations going on, sometime you may think this should be top priority but the town administration see that this is top priority.
",-1,-1
"And sometime people need just be more educated and sometime most of the g- people in this community if you just talk with them, and give 'em a chance to just get off some steam.
",-1,1
"You'd be surprised what kind of results you get from it.
",-1,-1
"You know, people don't- in Princeville don't like to be kept in the dark.
",-1,1
"There are uh, uh, they seem to be - people seem to wanna move to Princeville instead of out of Princeville.
",-1,1
"You know so the - To be in Princeville I guess is sort of a chance to a certain level anyway.
",-1,-1
"They want just come back home to  You know, so uh, uh, they knew the risk, has been and c- and could be, but we just talking about I live here.
",-1,-1
"So their roots, they just they wanna be here.
",-1,-1
"Sara Lee, that- I mean, that's- that's seem to be a household name around here, you know, Sara Lee.
",-1,-1
"You know, you have to be around here.
",-1,-1
"If you don't, you- you won't be long.
",-1,-1
"You know I've seen some people draw pictures to me would- could be artists, but you know they don't pursue it.
",-1,-1
"You know, and- and we need more leaders to be able to come in and pursue these kind of people to- to push 'em.
",-1,-1
"We don't- uh- it's sad to say but I wouldn't wanna say it for the record but it just we're not pushing our youth as hard as we should be pushing our youth to do- to bring out that talent.
",-1,1
"Well, I- I was in school and, um, I had taken, uh, management course, and one of my instructors uh, looked at me and said, you just have that pizazz to be a leader and not a follower.
",-1,-1
"There used to be a ball park across from the old town hall, back over in the wooded area.
",-1,1
"I decided that when Krystel was gonna leave his mayorship I no longer wanted to be there.
",-1,-1
"But see the hang up came because I had been calling the sheriff department inquiring about the water and they couldn't tell me anything or they wouldn't tell me anything  but nevertheless, I decided I had to do what had to be done, so neglecting myself, I leap from that chair in the office cause I was living in the apartment next to the office.
",-1,-1
"And this was gonna still be my home.
",-1,-1
"And I know- I knew too also that Princeville could not be Princeville any place else but here.
",-1,1
"See you- they could tell us to move down the highway about eleven miles, eight miles or six miles or five miles, that wouldn't be Princeville.
",-1,1
"I can remember right down here at this corner, there used to be a lumber yard.
",-1,1
"So this has to be Princeville.
",-1,-1
"There used to be a big old gin house thing, like a building there that used to have a occupy- a s- it used to well, house a store.
",-1,1
"I think it's a little place down here called S- uh, Shiloh Farm Road and those places and it's gonna have the meaning to me that these landmarks have when you come up into Princeville and know what used to be here.
",-1,-1
"I was hoping he could be here today for you to talk to him, but you can come back always and talk with him.
",-1,-1
"He says, realize now, you said you want the people to come back home, and you had to make the first move to show them they had to be strong and come back.
",-1,1
"But like I say- I kn- I know no place but Princeville and there's no place else for me to be.
",-1,-1
"And so this is the reason that I above and aboard of all things have to be honest about decisions I make.
",-1,-1
"Uh, everybody's baggage should be about the same.
",-1,1
"She even almost gave the property to the church to be built there.
",-1,-1
"That was uh, where the um, <ts founders area for Princeville, the town hall used to be there, there's an old picture down in the town uh, where you can see.
",-1,-1
"And there are pictures, there has to be pictures in the town hall I think now.
",-1,1
"And where you come in from over town coming around the curve, there- years ago it used to be um-  What was in there now?
",-1,-1
"Yeah that need to be torn.
",-1,-1
"You talk to Danise Who he supposed to be?
",-1,1
"Years ago she used to be a majorette in one of our high school bands.
",-1,1
"That would be good.
",-1,-1
"And the strangest thing, there used to be people like sitting on a corner on Main Street, and they used to call it Chris' corner, anybody can tell you that lived here years.
",-1,1
"And we did health workshops for them, where we would bring in the health department and any type of resource area that would be needed.
",-1,-1
"I didn't think it was gonna be like this, you know.
",-1,-1
"I mean he would come down and volunteer and help us every month, he was be there.
",-1,-1
"Uh, positions that would be needed, we had already put that down.
",-1,-1
"You know, how would uh, this person be uh, advised, and what kind of training you know, this person need.
",-1,-1
"And um, the, uh, copy of this uh, should be at the town hall now.
",-1,-1
"Because I saw there was change need to be made.
",-1,-1
"I don't mean to take uh, credit of everything, but if it's not going right, I'm not gonna be a part of it.
",-1,-1
"And uh, I'm a very strong stickler about people not doing things the way they supposed to be.
",-1,-1
"Because there's still a lot of work need to be done.
",-1,-1
"And keep everything in place like it's supposed to be.
",-1,1
"Because I know you've heard it, just like everybody say it's been a lot of dissension going on that wasn't needing to be.
",-1,-1
"If you go down Neville Street, make a left, and the row of houses on your left well it's supposed to be across from there, additional housing.
",-1,-1
"It used to be a store there um, convenience store and gas station.
",-1,1
"Their names will not be public.
",-1,-1
"You d- you- even though we might be a little country hick town but we still want a nice place to live you know, and live comfortably in- in the community where you stay, you don't wanna see that.
",-1,-1
"Instead of moving away, you know, they rather be here.
",-1,1
"That would be good.
",-1,-1
"I said, it might be a small community but there are needs and- and you know we been traveling these areas a long time, nobody has gotten hit by a train from that intersection but they have further down.
",-1,-1
"And when you come in from over town, cross the bridge where our little park is now, that used to be stores, little stores.
",-1,1
"And then it had little I call 'em shotgun houses, one and two rooms, sitting on the other side where the service station used to be.
",-1,1
"And I said, Sueann I think you better go over there and get Sueann, which was the yellow house where you see over there, that's where her house used to be.
",-1,1
"And I said Gerod why don't you spend the night over here with us and tomorrow morning we'll get up and see how it's gonna be.
",-1,-1
"I said, don't you do that, I said, you stay over here with us and just see you know, how it's gonna be.
",-1,-1
"And then there was a lot of things you had to do before you would be able to put the home here.
",-1,-1
"And make sure it was uh, standard uh, lever off the ground, it had to be three feet but I told them to go up one more.
",-1,-1
"I said, that is so precious and should be rewarded you know, for doing something like that.
",-1,-1
"I wish we could have a day of celebration where people could be contacted to come back and just to see now, and see what they've done to assist and helping us in this community.
",-1,-1
"I'll still be praising.
",-1,-1
"This what it gonna be.
",-1,-1
"This gonna be my home.
",-1,-1
"And if you can't along with us it'd be the best to speak to the ?
",-1,-1
"It's gonna be a little town now on the map.
",-1,-1
"Okay, the boy he's- is uh,  nine and he will be eleven October.
",-1,-1
"And then dad and mama had a bedroom, then there be the kitchen, we have a room.
",-1,1
"So keep praying for Princeville, is be alright.
",-1,-1
"You miss a lot that don't be love and kind.
",-1,1
"Yeah, she'll be in- I was in before she was anyway.
",-1,-1
"I had a job but I had to let it go because of the hour that- somebody had to be there with my daughter.
",-1,-1
"And we would be over there.
",-1,-1
"And some- it- sometime it'd be two or three families.
",-1,1
"Mm-hm, but it would be down Main Street but then come over there too.
",-1,-1
"Cause I was here then by myself and uh, I stayed sickly so she said she was gonna come home so she would be close to me.
",-1,-1
"Would it be alright?
",-1,-1
"It was back of Thorne- used to be Thorne Drug Store on the depot.
",-1,1
"And she had cancer and somebody had to be there with her day and night.
",-1,-1
"Now the brother next to me in Norfolk, he and h- his wife supposed to be down here Friday and stay the weekend.
",-1,-1
"Cause when our grandma was living  and our mother used to work over Rocky Mount, they would- all us would be over the railroad together.
",-1,1
"And they would always buy up a plenty stable food when they'd be working.
",-1,-1
"And they do- I said, don't feel bad cause I'm old enough to be her mama .
",-1,-1
"But the original property, um, would be over there in Princeville, right across from, um, the town hall now.
",-1,-1
"Yeah, it was a- it was a wonderful place just to- to stay and to live- to- to be raised up, yeah.
",-1,-1
"As a matter fact, uh, Zachariah would be the one I give her this credit.
",-1,1
"And um, and we- you- and you'd be surprised how many, um, Caucasian supporters- I call 'em my Caucasian brothers- uh, are sympathetic and can see that, um, that's part of the healing process.
",-1,-1
"Not necessarily to give us trillions of dollars but to acknowledge that a great wrong has been done, and something needs to be done to correct that because as long as you keep ignoring, um, the situation, and it continues to, um, fester, and um, it- it- it doesn't do the two injured parties- the oppressed is just as much, uh, injured as the suppressor.
",-1,-1
"And I thought it would be a good place for them to come and- and see, um, what- what progress hasn't been made and what progress has been made.
",-1,-1
"So, w- w- we'll get there and this H two- H forty bill is a bill that would be introduced by, uh, Congressman John Conyers, out of uh, Michigan.
",-1,-1
"Uh, for instance their uh- their behavior, their psychological inheritance of, uh, not being all they can be is um- is a result of being, uh, how do we say, uh, uh, descendants of Jim Crowism and racism.
",-1,1
"And some folks know about it and some folks don't, but um, I have to be sort of precarious about how I say it.
",-1,-1
"And uh, and you just have to be careful how you say what you say.
",-1,1
"It's long overdue, that something should be done.
",-1,-1
"But at the same time, they need to be gently awakened to say well, the only way we can get past that is to address it and go from there.
",-1,1
"And um, you had educators, uh, that would come in, uh, Doctor Marlee, who was a Jamaican, he would be the first one to set up a school here.
",-1,1
"Uh, I never did see him, but I saw my ma- uh- granddaddy would die for my father would be twelve years old, but uh, I hear daddy talk about it, say that um- that same uh, railroad track that runs east and west um, used to stop the- uh- and would let him off there coming from the roundhouse in uh- in Rocky Mount.
",-1,-1
"And I used to be so mischievous man.
",-1,1
"And uh, today that would be looked upon as abuse.
",-1,-1
"And I'd be just as- I'm'a tell you.
",-1,1
"And the third boy uh, Shaylene he would be hit by uh, a car.
",-1,-1
"I don't know what happened to Zeth, but I would be - I would land on the front porch of my Uncle Juante's house in the swing.
",-1,-1
" then get bombs all over us go outside and be playing around again then we go over um someones place burn records call somebody up make jokes you know to be enemies
