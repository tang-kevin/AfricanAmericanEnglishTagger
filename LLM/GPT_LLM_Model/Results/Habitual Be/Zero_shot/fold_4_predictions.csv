",-1,-1
"To be honest.
",-1,-1
"I mean, and we could be all over the neighborhood, you know, um, playing, jump rope, double-dutch whatever going to the rec.

",-1,1
"They have a- you know, they have to have a certain amount where they- that has to be affordable, uh, rent.
",-1,-1
"No one should be homeless in the United States of America, period.
",-1,-1
"You can build at least three or four places for people to be able to live affordably.
",-1,1
"You know, it's- it's crazy, and that's- I had to tell my son that please be grateful about what you have cause it's kids out here who don't have any thing.

"So please be grateful and thankful.

",-1,-1
"Not at all of 'em, but just- you know, you can, Especially when you go to see a younger go go band or something like that, you know, it's a lot of younger people there, it's just seemed to be trouble, but as far as the music itself, the music itself is amazing.
",-1,-1
"Cranking for somebody else could be the roll of toms.
",-1,-1
"Was she ha- Oh cause she could be taken- Did she have, like, kids or something there?
",-1,-1
"She can be taken care of there.
",-1,-1
"Yeah, she had my aunt there, Aunt Domonique, cause she can be taken care of there, so.
",-1,-1
"It could be elementary school, middle school, high school.
",-1,-1
"But I already know that, you know, and joning is- is ca- is- Think about- It can be looked at, I guess, as bad you talk- but, nah, like for us it made you tougher.
",-1,-1
"So, I know I had a big head, so I didn't have to worry about, you know, okay, I know now, at first, I used to be like ah, they talking about my head, now it's oh yeah, you right.
",-1,-1
"You had to be good at Madden.
",-1,1

",-1,1
"But, If I played it, and really got to learn, you know, you have to learn the- to learn it, then I'll be good at it.

"Just to be satisfied with Oh we made a thousand dollars, or we made- No!
",-1,1
"Will Otto Porter be playing this summer?
",-1,-1
"Um, cause I know that you are studying to be a chef.
",-1,-1
"It's gonna be extremely profitable, and- See what happens there.
",-1,-1
"Just- my long term goal is just to be - happy.
",-1,-1
"So, if you could leave- let's say you had unlimited resources, and you could leave tomorrow, where would the first stop be?
",-1,-1
"And lunchings- ca- can be used as a person, place, or thing.
",-1,1
"You could be like, that's lunching.
",-1,-1
"Or you could be like, you know, he's lunching.
",-1,-1
"Or, you know what I'm saying, or something that you do very well, we'll be like, nigga I'm tight.
",-1,1
"But, you know, some people think it's  trying to get all the black folks out I just think it's just trying to be a- the richer environment.
",-1,-1
"You know, they could be just forcing niggas out, you know what I'm saying.
",-1,1
"But that's how it's always gonna be.
",-1,1
"Until everybody's willing to be together and stand up to fight for the cause.
",-1,-1
"Until then it's gonna be whatever they want, how they want, and when they want.
",-1,1
"But we really wouldn't know until we able to fight for the cause and get what we want right inf- in- in front of us, so it'll be shown instead of going off what everybody else is saying and it's going the other way but the whole plan was to go the other way the whole time.
",-1,-1
"But you'll never be able to know that until you open your eyes.
",-1,-1
"We probably couldn't get everything we wanted to get but it made me to be the person who I am today, you know what I'm saying.
",-1,-1
"Uh, my g- guess would probably be like barbecue sauce, and hot sauce mixed.
",-1,-1
"My guess would be.
",-1,-1
"Like You can go to like a rap hip-hop jont and you gotta wait for people to battle, for you to be like, oh they said my neighborhood, or oh, this and that.
",-1,1
"Like Chuck Brown'd be like more slow pace.
",-1,1
"Um, I mean it was all your choice but yeah it was a lot of people in the crowd and- Whether it be a lot of people standing to the crowd it was packed house every night, I'll tell you that.
",-1,-1
"It wouldn't be what it is today if it wasn't what it was back in the day.
",-1,-1
"The memory I have would to be always keep your grass cut so you can see the snakes coming.
",-1,-1
"That'd be it.

"Your top three teams in the area n- you don't care what the other teams is doing they- if they're in the finals and you have to be there and only pick these three teams are there, and they're in a championship situation which one would you wanna go celebrate with?
",-1,-1
"It would probably be my Redskins first, then my Wizards.
",-1,-1
"And probably- I don't know it's probably be a tie between baseball and hockey.
",-1,-1
"It'd probably be a tie.
",-1,-1
"Oh you tryna be funny.

",-1,-1
"You may have heard the music but what- what got you over that hump that be - that- that made you love it?
",-1,-1
"So the first song I would have to say would be - See you wouldn't know if I told- I'm'a say one you know, um- I guess the Tupac song, cause you know, go go is like a reenactment of s- industry songs.
",-1,-1
"They might not be a r-  go go got- is like a reenactment of in- they have they own songs too that they make, but it's majority of like- like, what's the word I'm looking for?
",-1,1
"Sometimes it- you know, you might be like, aight Rihanna did it.
",-1,-1
"Niggas might be like, oh Capitol Heights, might throw your city out there.
",-1,-1
"You know what I'm saying, so we listen to that shit, it might be certain things that we do like, certain songs, like, oh aight I can- I can get with this, with the whole- as the whole genre, we can't really get with it.
",-1,-1
"You know what I'm saying, I used to- I used to be the singer in that band.
",-1,1
"So they used to be like, aight well we gonna put you- You know, I just migrated to the second mic.
",-1,-1
"Tell me about like some restaurants, some- tell me about some spots that- that used to be in the city that you usually go to when you- you know, when you were there.
",-1,-1
"People think they know what's going on, some people probably came up with some good shit, but ain't nothing like- Mumbo sauce gotta be nice and thick.
",-1,-1
"You know what I'm saying, you supposed to be able to see a nigga coming from down the street.
",-1,-1
"you ain't supposed to be doing or you getting over on people you doing whatever and somebody coming back, you don't see 'em now, you slipping.
",-1,-1
"You know, you might be out there selling drugs or what have you, the police might ride up on you, you don't see 'em, next thing you know they chasing you down, you was slipping.
",-1,-1
"Shit I have to really be talking to, you know what I'm saying.
",-1,-1
"So we might be like, where the blams at?
",-1,-1
"I might come in and be like, hey where the blam- you know where the blams at?
",-1,-1
"Blimmy or bla- blimmy and- Blimmy or blam means f- it could be used as female.
",-1,-1
"Like, yeah how many blams gonna be there?
",-1,-1
"So I might be like, man, uh, man, like- like- like- t- the jacket you got on, man, now that joint sclusy as shit, where the fuck you get that joint from?
",-1,-1
"I mean, it- it- it could, it could, it could be like- you know what I'm saying, like, man that joint sclusy son.

",-1,-1
"I would just like to be the- uh, use my creative side of my mind on all of these type of things.
",-1,-1
"Yeah, that's- that's really- that's really my main goal, but I was just thought that maybe a book would be easier than to write a movie script.
",-1,-1
"So if I do these things, if I sit down and get these things accomplished, then when it's time for me to go forward and look for that right person to- to- to- to amplify my- my- my- my- my, um, accomplishments, then I will be you know, in a good position.
",-1,-1
"You know, um, whoever write the Be More Careful books and shit like that, the- the novels, the crime novels.
",-1,-1
"You know what I'm saying, like s- Well- aight, well, th- th- well, what they say, that is from whatever we been taught to know like, whoever made a lot of inventions that- that the- uh, white people tell it that- that's been taught to us that- for us to be taught that well a white person made this, actually's been made by a black person.
