",-1,1
"Um, and then my father kind of put in my mind, I know you can do this because I raised you so that you can be self sufficient.
",-1,1
"Not to say that was gonna be the end, but I wanted to make sure that I could af- All the things that my parents were able to give me, I wanted to always make sure I was able to give her.
",-1,-1
"She didn't ask to be a part of the confusion or the choices that I had made.
",-1,-1
"So I wanted her to have the experience of knowing that our world is not just black or African American, whichever way you term- I wanted her to be able to get along with all people cause that's the way I raised her cause that's the way I was raised.
",-1,1

",-1,-1
"It's gonna be hard.
",-1,-1
"It's gonna be challenging, cause now she's really fighting for survival.
",-1,-1

",-1,1
"So like I said if I needed s- to be somewhere, or needed to go somewhere, my dad drove me.
",-1,-1
"So what as I would look at now, saying, Okay, well yeah you can go hang out with your friends and just be back home at a certain time, no.
",-1,-1
"She still had something in her that someone with all the money in the world could see some good in her, and it just turned to be like a positive thing.
",-1,-1
"You just wanna just be.
",-1,-1
"You didn't judge me cause- And I love that because I look at that's how people really should be.
",-1,-1
"You know, you can make it what you want it to be, Mm.

",-1,1
"They took- Uh, there was a restaurant growing up, used to be very famous for their um, chicken wings and their steak and cheese sandwiches.

",-1,1
"Actually that might be stretching it.
",-1,-1
"Probably would have to be the statue of Martin Luther King.
",-1,-1
"Um, that's probably- that's- that would have to be my favorite now.
",-1,1
"But um, to be able to use the comparison between the two, I enjoyed that.
",-1,-1

",-1,-1
"To thine own self be true.
",-1,1

",-1,1
"But it's not from the perspective of killing yourself physically, it's killing yourself from a spiritual perspective that- I don't have to be right all the time.

"That's why I just- you know, me and my mom didn't always have a good relationship, but for her to be a single mom, I think that now at this age that I am, I respect the fact that she was able to do what she did by herself.
",-1,-1
"Sometimes you got to be careful what you ask for.
",-1,1
"Because, first off, my daughter is- She can be kind of mean or I don't know what the word to describe that thing.
",-1,-1
"I let them be homeowners.
",-1,1
"Um, when Christen come home, she'll have a home that she ain't got to be afraid in as- as I was.
",-1,-1
"And I still appreciate that because for him to be so young and to think like he was thinking, I needed that.
",-1,-1
"I can be your grandchild.
",-1,-1
"Everything gonna be alright?
",-1,-1
"You know, a lot of people wait til they kids get to be about thirteen, fourteen.
",-1,-1
"I'd be like, Mayor, why do you keep doing this shit?
",-1,1
"I would call him, and he'd be like, oh Lord, and he would run down the steps to get Marion Barry off the street.
",-1,1
"I mean he'd be so drunk in the morning, open the door and fall out the damn car.
",-1,-1
"But people thought Marion Barry was gonna be around forever.
",-1,-1
"that he would be in office forever.
",-1,-1
"Say like, if you were, um, renovating a house, in phases, it has to be inspected.
",-1,-1
"If y'all gonna be on it, and we gonna do the inspections, you can't think that we don't have nothing to do but sit here and wait for you.
",-1,1
"Used to be Sabin's Record Store, and I worked in there, you know how singing groups and everybody come to the record store to promote their music and stuff, and The Soul Searchers came in there that day.
",-1,-1
"We'll be like, What?
",-1,1
"It would be funny.
",-1,-1
"Grandma- Grandma, you- I think I- I think I'm gonna be a man next month.
",-1,-1
"You're gonna be a man next month.
",-1,-1
"Caitlyn can be a woman.
",-1,-1
"I'm just- What's- what's gonna be your new name?
",-1,-1
"All that money a man has, all he could wanna be is a woman?
",-1,-1
"I know but you adopted me so I might be able to get on her level.
",-1,-1
"Be able to take care of yourself.
",-1,-1
"They gonna be alright.
",-1,-1
"I have tried to really tell her that you can't be afraid.
",-1,-1
"And that's why Grandma said you need to be independent.
",-1,-1
"But now that I've been in those three car accidents, I'm never gonna be inaudible.
",-1,-1
"You got- I w- You got other things to be scared of than driving.
",-1,-1
"Oh Grandma do you- I w- I wish that's all I had to be scared of.
",-1,-1
"You never put yourself in predicament to be, um, what's the word I wanna use?
",-1,1
"And when I got locked up I looked at myself, I said how stupid can you be?
",-1,-1
"How stupid can you be?
",-1,-1
"And it- it- it- it changed my life, seeing how I don't wanna be.
",-1,-1
"But something gotta be installed in your mind because with them it's not your parents.
",-1,1
"You gotta be back Sunday.
",-1,1
"Instead of saying, hey honey, I don't wanna be bothering with you no more.
",-1,-1
"So we ha- there had to be a time whereas that they have to- it- the- the- the- the- the, uh- the recreation department had to stand so you can get on the bus.
",-1,-1
"You gonna wind up in jail, you gonna be dead.
",-1,-1
"We wanna always- we wanna be the one sit up there and prove you wrong.
",-1,1
"That- that was- that was the worlds was working and- and making money cause I wanna look and- and this, that- and be popular.
",-1,1
"You be .
",-1,1
"What- Jeanne you wanted to be here to, uh, six.
",-1,-1
"H- O-  Well, hey Ketan, this need to be done.
",-1,-1
"Well only thing wasn't honest was you saying that you wasn't sposta be here.
",-1,-1
"Not only that, now I'm gonna get fired because I wasn't sposta be at the job, this that and the other, because, you know, they got, you know, security, this that and the other, I want- I'm like, Mm.
",-1,-1
"Only thing you- your thing was living in Southeast, you just wanna be a part of it.
",-1,-1
"No- I'm like this because I'm like this cause I- I- my- m- my baby brother, which is cause I used to go- I used to be a wallflower.
",-1,-1
"I wanna be the best.
",-1,-1
"You wind up getting stabbed, shot, this that and the other, or it'd be a fight.
",-1,-1
"Ain't no way this is where we can't be at.
",-1,-1
"It came to be a- a u- a unity thing.
",-1,-1
"I said I'll be back to see you.
",-1,-1
"It ain't gonna be the same.
",-1,-1
"And then- and then the parents that had them can't be no more than what, two- two, uh, two- three years older than they are, and still babies having babies, but none of 'em got no education.
",-1,-1
"And that's why I tell my kids, if you do the right things, you ain't got no reason to be shaking your leg, this that and the other, scared, this that- if you ain't do nothing wrong, what you- what you got to hide?
",-1,-1
"You hate- you hate it, but that is n- that is not us to be worried about.
",-1,-1
"Bunch of them live other there and we would all be outside together playing and stuff.
",-1,1
"That had to be like the funnest moment of living over there.
",-1,-1
"That's what I'm debating about whether I wanna be upstairs or downstairs.
",-1,-1
"But if I do go downstairs, that room will be the guest room, th- their room.
",-1,-1
"But it'll be your space.
",-1,-1
"And see then, when you get older, you won't wanna be with your parents upstairs all the time.
",-1,1
"Trust me, take the room downstairs, you'll be happy that you did it.
",-1,-1
"I promise you, you'll be like, oh my god I'm so glad I took the room downstairs.
",-1,-1
"If you take the room upstairs, you not gonna be as happy.
",-1,-1
"You'll be like, I'm so glad I took Miss Larren's advice.
",-1,-1
"Cause it seems like they just have to be right since they're the teachers.
",-1,1
"Uh, favorite teachers would have to be Miss- no I do have a favorite teacher this year, his name is Mr. Neftali.
",-1,1
"Last year, my favorite teacher would have to be - not last year but like, back.
",-1,-1
"My favorite teachers would have to be Miss Darrin, and Miss Aniceto.
",-1,1
"It'll be a nice Hm.
",-1,-1
"Th- in the case of this like, district and everything, they'd be consider third class due to not everything that they have.
",-1,-1
"Do you- so do you think- do you think be - Mm, so let me ask you this question cause you're- you're very intelligent.
",-1,-1
"And I feel like it shouldn't be but, you know, you can't- Have you ever experienced a time when either money or race or even being a girl mattered?
",-1,-1
"What do you wanna be when you grow up?
",-1,-1
"So I d- I'd rather be that or an actress.
",-1,-1
"What inspired you to wanna be those things?
",-1,-1
"Um, what inspired you to be?
",-1,-1
"Cause I'm like, who does- who wants to come and work then be bossed by somebody?
",-1,-1
"You're like, I don't know which school I should be going to.
",-1,-1
"Can't be perfect all the time.
",-1,1
"Can't be perfect all the time?
",-1,1
"It's just I try to be right cause I don't like being wrong.
",-1,1
"Is it- I always try to be right and I ha- and I do forget to think about it sometimes before I say it but, you know.
",-1,1
"And I wanted to make sure we were cool cause we- no f-  um, friend relationship should be ended over something the other person doing.
",-1,-1
"But it's not a point where I would be like, what it- when my- with my friend Maurie, I know I could trust her with everything, I could really pour into her.
",-1,-1
"We could talk, we communicate, we could be cordial, but like a s- a deep secret that's like haunting me or something, I wouldn't tell it to her probably.
",-1,-1
"Like, c- cause I was with Justo and Justo and Diandre ain't really wanna be my friends cause they thought I would b- I was betraying them.
",-1,-1
"And then you got badges, and we took tests on how to be like, a good friend and manners and everything.
",-1,1
"And we- and we always learned stuff, you like learned how to be a proper young lady.
",-1,1
"Uh, I go there like if I'm not doing nothing on a Sunday, like if my mom's not having work and I'm like her- gotta be her little assistant.
",-1,1
"How much longer you think you gonna be, Dinorah?
",-1,-1
"I mean, it's cool cause of like some of the songs cause my dad used to be in a band where they played go go music.
",-1,1
"And I like the beats that they'll be  to like, da da da da da da da da da, da da da, like the beats and everything.
",-1,1
"Mm-mm, no she ha- she has her own- um, she has- she wanted to be like on one level.
",-1,-1
"And always I'll- wherever I went I will always make friends or be a sociable person, so it wasn't easy for me- it wasn't hard, I'm sorry.
",-1,1
"And normally it'll be like, fifteen of us.
",-1,1
"And it would be like, two people that they would- they would go out and look for us.
",-1,-1
"So I would be in the neighborhood with that mostly.
",-1,1
"Our- my class will be like, the fourth- yeah, the fourth class to graduate from the Stuart high school part.
",-1,1
"Cause he's gonna be our president for the next four years.
",-1,-1
"Or might be even eight.
",-1,-1
"I don't- I don't shy them down or dumb them down, be like, oh, you- you're not listening to me, you're not right anyway I just- I state my thing, state my reason, and if you don't like it, or if you don't agree with it I continue on.
",-1,-1
"Because you seem to be like a very wise seventeen year old, like you sound like you're like an old- Old man.
",-1,1
"You- like your friends or your grades are not where you want them to be.
",-1,-1
"You- you think- while you have that test and you have that twenty minutes to be quiet, you think about what's going on.
",-1,-1
"And I can't let none of that, none of the outsiders or the negative energy distract me from getting to where I need to be.
",-1,-1
"And to have adults behind you that supports you, and on Saturdays while you at home doing nothing they have activities planned for you to go to like a event, or learn how to be leaders.
",-1,1
"That's- that's- I don't think you can get- you can't get that at any other school, any other- any other place where kids could be.
",-1,-1
"I would wanna be different, I don't wanna do the same thing that you're doing, or- Let me- let me- let me just think about it differently than you.
",-1,-1
"We gonna be like this.
",-1,1
"And in my family, I will be the first male to graduate from high school and continue to college.
",-1,-1
"I will be the only male to do that.
",-1,-1
"You gon- you gonna be something in life.
",-1,-1
"it takes going to college to be successful?
",-1,-1
"You don't have to go to school to be successful.
",-1,-1
"That's me personally, but I- I- me personally I would go to school to be successful cause that's what I wanna do.
",-1,-1
"Like something's gonna happen to you, or some- you just felt like, oh my god, this is it, my life is about to be over right now.
",-1,-1
"Cause I didn't wanna be another Trayvon Martin, or another Michael Brown, or another- or or another statistic on being killed.
",-1,-1
"I didn't want that to be my reality.
",-1,-1
"And I had my hoodie on so of course I was gonna be a suspect.
",-1,-1
"What makes you so confident that you don't have to be afraid?
",-1,-1
"I'm not gonna be disrespectful, I'm not looking for a problem.
",-1,-1
"I think if that incident went the wrong way, of course I would- of course my family and stuff would be sad.
",-1,-1
"And that's why I wanna be successful in life.
",-1,-1
"And it may not be good for people that's renting an apartment.
",-1,-1
"Or that may- um, or the apartment may- or the apartment building may be sold or- or bought by another person and now their rent is increasing by a thousand dollars, five hundred, two thousand.
",-1,-1
"And after that they have a mock trial in which you're the plaintiff, defendant, or in our case I think it is gonna be defendant and prosecution.
",-1,-1
"My godsister, she wants to be a lawyer also.
",-1,1
"While you may- while you may- you claim that you may go home and the fridge might not be nothing while you had sardines and- sardines and rice and stuff, and beans and stuff was waiting for you at dinner.
",-1,-1
"So, it- you don't- you don't have to- you don't have to talk about the struggle to be popular.
",-1,-1
"That may not be your reality.
",-1,-1
"Rap about how you gonna go out here and be successful in life.
",-1,1
"Just because you can go out here and buy whatever you want, yeah that may be good for a few days but after a while, it's not gonna make you happy.
",-1,-1
"Be yourself.
",-1,1
"Like that's my-  Like, it could be anything.
",-1,-1
"But it's a time and a place where language should be used.
",-1,-1
"And my last question, if you had to leave a piece of advice to whoever you want to leave it to, what would that advice be?
",-1,-1
"Have the courage to be yourself.
",-1,1
"Be yourself.
",-1,1
"Have the courage to be yourself.
",-1,1
"And have a peace of mind and be around positive people.
",-1,1
"And they- they out here- they doing- they doing what they wanna do cause they wanna fit in, they wanna be accepted by they boys, they homies.
",-1,1
"And it was like, Kareema oh we already know you not gonna be going, your parents ain't going for that.
",-1,1
"If I go to that party, that might- that party may be the very party that mess up my life for the rest.
",-1,-1
"It won't be no going to Hampton no becoming no lawyer.
",-1,-1
"How does it feel to be a- uh, Halloween baby?
",-1,-1
"So then we moved to, uh, Deandrae Street, and when we- my parents first showed us the house, I was really impressed just because I never thought we'd be able to live in that type of neighborhood.
",-1,-1
"Um, and I just think that would also be really interesting to do.
",-1,-1
"So I was struggling, but eventually I figured it out and I became pretty popular I guess and had a lot of friends and so I guess they just wanted like a black girl that was like, I don't know, that would just like, be silent and like follow all the rules and stuff.
",-1,-1
"So I applied to become an RA and like, I knew I'd be good with it- good at it cause I'm good with people and like interacting and like I'm a big sister, and I love being a big sister so like, I'm good at helping people and I'm comfortable doing that.
",-1,-1
"Um, but next year I'm gonna be in Andra with, uh, upperclassmen which is great.
",-1,-1
"Oh you're not gonna be an RA next year.
",-1,-1
"I'm gonna just be in like a suite.
",-1,-1
"So I'll be living with other people.
",-1,-1
"Um, do you- how do you think it'll be with upperclassmen?
",-1,-1
"But with the upperclassmen I'll have to like put in more effort in the interactions that I do have with them just to make sure that they're getting the most out of it and that I'm being like, as helpful as I can be for them.
",-1,1
"Um, y- uh, no, just because like, with preregistration I'm able to like mentally prepare  for what my schedule's gonna be and I've been lucky I've been able to get all the classes I sign up for.
",-1,1
"Um, but I also had upperclassmen, and you do have to be more intentional.
",-1,1
"I'm- Like it's really draining  to have to be like, excited to see my freshmen all the time when I really just wanna go lay down.
",-1,1
"I don't necessarily know if it should be right after college but my mom thinks I should go because Trump is president so I might not find a job.
",-1,-1
"Um, so like I like going places where I know there's gonna be parking and just like I know how to get there.
",-1,-1
"Actually April sixth will be a full year since I got my license.
",-1,-1
"Like for him, he's made it in life cause he never thought he'd be a- doing the things he does and like living where he live- where we live now.
",-1,-1
"Um, you actually have to be like emotionally present and like, more involved.
",-1,1
"Like whatever you all want to eat  but then when we would tell him like- Cause there's sometimes where I like- Cause like I resent that they call me high maintenance cause like, sure I'd love to go to the Capitol Grille all the time but I also could eat at McDonald's and like, get a fish fillet and be content with life.
