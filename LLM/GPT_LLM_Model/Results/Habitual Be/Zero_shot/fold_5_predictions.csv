",-1,-1
"And so many intelligent people, because m- And I mean, it may just be me, but my father's line, you know- We have intelligent people in our family, very very intelligent people.
",-1,1
"Could be on the streets selling herself for all I know.
",-1,-1
"And I had to be brought back out the bubble once I was old enough to understand.
",-1,-1
"Next week will be good.
",-1,-1
"No, Monday I'll be at a conference.
",-1,-1
"And she had us at a early age, so Adan's about to be sixteen.
",-1,-1
"He can't- a woman shouldn't be doing that.
",-1,-1
"A woman should be at home taking- like, that's why I said my mother's a stay at home mom.
",-1,1
"She should be at home taking care of her children, so they're having that little crisis right now, and he's resorting to more and more alcohol.
",-1,-1
"Cause you had to be the older sibling even though you weren't the oldest.
",-1,-1
"Um, I had to be the oldest.
",-1,-1
"Mm- That'd be great.
",-1,-1
"I thought we were gonna be like, and they were born in DC,  Nah, I'm not sure.
",-1,-1
"Um, to be honest with you, it wasn't that bad because my sisters are way older than me.
",-1,-1
"Like it would be gunshots right outside my backyard.
",-1,1
"Just- To be honest with you, just being with my friends.
",-1,1
"We- Uh, I don't have one specific memory to be truthfully honest with you.
",-1,-1
"And my mother said, no, you're not gonna be with your friends no more.
",-1,-1
"I could be watching you on TV.
",-1,-1
"So, I- I- I ain't gon- To be honest with you, I don't like to think about high school because I was so miserable throughout the whole four years.
",-1,-1
"And the rest of the people I don't- I don't really wanna be associated with none of the people that went to that school.
",-1,-1
"And I- I- I wasn't familiar with the Georgetowns or the- the George Washington- I weren't familiar with those areas, so I would just be on Georgia Avenue, Fourteenth Street, U Street, uh, those areas on down.
",-1,-1
"I think it'll be nice.
",-1,-1
"When I got to college, I wanted to be in college.
",-1,-1
"I wanted to know what it was like to go to school around white people and be around white people, and I wanted- And it was in the mountains, so I wanted somewhere where I could study and h- it didn't have any distractions.
",-1,-1
"I'm not sure to be truthfully honest with you.
",-1,-1
"Other than that, I will always be in Southeast.
",-1,1
"I need to go be a tourist.
",-1,-1
"Well of course it would have to be Martin Luther King.
",-1,-1
"I s- I studied Abraham Lincoln, so it's- it's nothing you can aks me that I wouldn't be an answer.
",-1,-1
"Actually I wouldn't be able to ask you much cause I'm not very knowledgable.
",-1,-1
"So what do you think you- What- If you had to say, that's my dream job, what would that be?
",-1,-1
"To be engineer, a mechanical engineer.
",-1,-1
"Like, it c- it could be a plane engine, boat engine.
",-1,-1
"I'll be looking out for your name.
",-1,-1
"I have no reason to be in Virginia.
",-1,-1
"To be honest with you, I never kn- I never really knew about Virginia until I w- started working in Virginia.
",-1,-1
"If you could leave one piece of advice to- to young black men, but also just to the youth in general, what would that piece of advice be?
",-1,-1
"Just try not to fall into the trap of You have to be a certain way.
",-1,-1
"Just be yourself.
",-1,1
"So that's how my mentality is not, I need to be like this.
",-1,-1
"So, I w- I would just try to tell them to try to- Because- If you- Growing up in that environment and growing up around those people, you can't help but wanna be like that.
",-1,1
"So th- I- That's- That would be my advice.
",-1,-1
"I just think that would be difficult because that person has to want to do it.
",-1,-1
"Her name was supposed to be Christin, and I'm still salty about that.
",-1,-1
"be quiet, get it together.
",-1,-1
"So I read it to just try to get my mind to focus on other things and try to be calm- calm and well mannered instead of being stressed.
",-1,-1
"I don't really have a favorite anything, but of course my favorite TV show right now will have to be Power.
",-1,-1
"would have to be Power.
",-1,-1
"anything Chinese felated would always be the carry out.
",-1,1
"That's why I said gentrification would be good cause we- they can give us these restaurants so we don't have to keep eating this junk food.
",-1,-1
"I would be in the party while people was partying to it, listening to go go.
",-1,1
"Uh, that- that would be it, looking at the girls dance to g- to go go.
",-1,-1
"I might be off a year or two.
",-1,-1
"And after the class of ninety-eight, they went back to going to neighborhood schools because it was difficult for parents to be active in the schools because they were so far.
",-1,-1
"which was good because it allowed us to be kind of interactive in the schools as a community and also for the parents.
",-1,-1
"In high school I was very mature, what defined me was I think my ability to kind of be a chameleon Mm-hm.
",-1,1
"And my new nickname for DC is diversity city because it's so much diversity in DC where as it used to be predominantly African American in a lot of areas in DC.
",-1,-1
"Just to be a part of that change where it's kind of like a new breath is being breathe into the body of DC, so.
",-1,-1
"Union Station was the spot to be  when I was younger.
",-1,1
"to kind of spice it up, you know, so people would not be like- Cause me, I wouldn't know their music.
",-1,-1
"Cause that can be mm, you know.
",-1,-1
"Because as the oldest I just felt so responsible to come back and kind of be a leader to my younger siblings.
",-1,1
"And then also to just show them that you can come from very humble beginnings but that doesn't mean that you have to be a product of your environment.
",-1,-1
"Or you can get married, you don't have to just be, you know, a baby's mama.
",-1,-1
"You know, you can be a wife.
",-1,-1
"You can  you can be a business owner.
",-1,-1
"Um, and I want- I wanna say this was challenging and rewarding, this is gonna be both.
",-1,-1
"I'm thinking that, hey Tymeka you're smart, you know, it's online, it'll be easy.
",-1,-1
"So is this your- um, I know you said you love your job, is this your be all end all?
",-1,-1
"I can't say what my- I would love to be  actually.
",-1,-1
"To be a CEO.
",-1,-1
"I actually would like to be more involved on the program side, um, as well as, you know, the support.
",-1,-1
"But I would also like to be more involved with the kids.
",-1,-1
"Um, so if I could have a position here where I kind of touched on all of those- all of those- all of those pieces at once, I think that that'd be the ideal position for me.
",-1,-1
"inaudible And it's gonna be there, on every job description.
",-1,-1
"Because that's- that's gonna be - Know that.
",-1,-1
"This gonna be your major bullet point right here, this is what we want you to do.
",-1,-1
"and I don't want to- that- I want to be at a place where I'm communicating effectively.
",-1,1
"Or where, you know, I may have a strength and that's your weakness that we can work together and team together, you know what I'm saying, to- to- to make that be your strength as well.
",-1,1
"And like I said that would be one area that I can say I am lacking in.
",-1,1
"And I don't think that at this point, the point where I am now I'm doing that as effectively as I should be.
",-1,1
"So I'm gonna go to one of their meetings in February and just kind of see what it's all about and if it's something that would be helpful to me, but.
",-1,-1
"We'll- I'll be in the office all day.
",-1,1
"And that'll be our first piece.
",-1,1
"And she just started crying and she's like, this'll be my last vote- time voting, I'm sure.
",-1,-1
"And I have my fingers crossed, I say it every season, this is gonna be our year.
",-1,-1
"So I'm gonna say that again, this is gonna be our year.
",-1,-1
"Yup, it- whichever way it goes, I'm- I'm'a be a Redskin fan for life.
",-1,1
"I started my own business, it'll be four years in January.
",-1,-1
"And I liked it, but I- I just wanted to be more hands on in the planning part of it.
",-1,1
"Um, she came to me and it was like maybe like four months before her wedding and she was just like, I know  it's gonna be good but I don't think it's gonna come together like I i- like I have it in my mind.
",-1,-1
"I tell people- I also do Lyft part time, so I tell, um, gentrifiers, as they're called, when they get in my vehicle, um, when they aks me about DC, I say, if you hear the name of your street mentioned in a- a- a old go go song, just know your neighborhood used to be hood.
",-1,1
"It w- it was a big deal to be from DC back in the day.
",-1,1
"So it kind of gave me perspective, um, knowing that there was something else out there, not to be limited to just what I saw around me.
",-1,1
"So we would just be out, um, walking around through Alexandria.
",-1,-1
"Because now PG County, it was starting to grow with this DC influence so it was like a new mix, um, of- of just what it was to be from DC, it was like- And- and honestly, my uncle- and h- there's a- there's a article online, my uncle- I have that uncle that swear he came up with the phrase DMV.
",-1,-1
"And you know the U Street crowd and the Adams Morgan vibe when it- when it w- used to be just like a bunch of people standing around, saying hey, having fun, drinking.
",-1,1
"we would go grab us, um, a couple of outfits, and then we would figure out what we was gonna wear that weekend, and we would be out every weekend.
",-1,1
"You could be standing next to somebody that just like, owns half the daggone block and you're just standing there next to them at Panera just getting a sandwich.
",-1,-1
"If I am from anywhere else in the world, and I come to the city that's supposed to be the city that houses the leader of the free world, I don't wanna see no homeless guy pissing on the corner.
",-1,-1
"Like I think DC needed to be cleaned up, like honest to goodness, like it just- it just needed like a facelift.
",-1,-1
"with the money to spend that should soon be getting married after they live this life in the city and they decide they're ready to settle down.
",-1,-1
"You would be building long term things not short term spaces.
",-1,1
"Cause it- it can be taught.
",-1,-1
"Like I feel like with entrepreneurship we can start to shift the balance because the whole slave thing, well, we need people to be slaves.
",-1,-1
"There are some, but there are not as many as there need to be.
",-1,1
"And it's not as much as a push as there should be for like actually focusing on, okay- You know, what's done is done.
",-1,1
"Y'all can f- forget about getting whatever y'all want back, because they gonna slap so many zeros behind that tag, it's r- it's gonna be ridiculous.
",-1,-1
"I don't think that's safe, I don't think there should be a building up there.
",-1,-1
"And it's gonna be that way for a while because they figured out what works.
",-1,1
"Just like, you know, suburban, like they can still walk, you know, home and ride their bikes to work and th- you know, go out and have a good time and, you know, still be safe and, you know.
",-1,1
"I think they are trying to, But I think even if they put all the buildings that they wanted up, and they did everything they could to kind of make it this new, shiny space, east of the river has a disconnect from the rest of the city so it's never gonna quite be like downtown or uptown or anything like that.
",-1,-1
"And even just the fact that everything that's around east of the river it's it's still gonna be those people.
",-1,1
"You have to approach it with I know stuff but it could be wrong.
",-1,-1
"Like, if you talk to anyone, and this could be black or white, they know that, okay, in Virginia, you may get pulled over for less and held for more.
",-1,-1
"Versus driving in DC, whereas you have to be doing something almost extreme for them to really mess with you.
",-1,-1
"So if I say, police are press in- press in Virginia, they're like- you know, somebody from the outside must be like, oh wow maybe cause that's a predominantly white area, you think police are more likely to pull you over cause you're black in Virginia.
",-1,-1
"Like you gotta go to like a regional park like it's gonna be like a county park or a state park just to get a trail to go jog if you wanted to.
",-1,1
"It's- it's cool because again, I'm one of those people that need freedom, I need to be able to do it when I want to, so it's good for me.
",-1,-1
"And so when you meet somebody who's from DC or even from this area that grew up in this area, wait I didn't think there was anybody from here, so now li- like, there must be a story.
",-1,-1
"So when you have those two things coming together, like, oh my g- there has to be some amazing crazy story that happened to you.
",-1,-1
"Did you- You know, I mean, like it has to be something crazy, like, right?
",-1,-1
"Um, decided that, you know, the way that it was set up she wasn't gonna be able to do her job as expected because the kitchen was too far from the tent.
",-1,-1
"So she wanted the bride to pay for another tent so that she could have her own tent to be set up in.
",-1,-1
"But regardless, she- the bride paid for a tent so that the caterer could be closer to the- to the actual tent that the reception was in.
",-1,-1
"She's like, oh, no I'm not doing that, if I do it it's gonna be another hun- two hundred and fifty dollars.
",-1,-1
"She's supposed to be blissfully blind the entire day so that even if stuff does go wrong, she don't know about it.
",-1,-1
"Maybe you shouldn't be in this business, lady.
",-1,-1
"But there should be some s- other people underneath the chef and other people underneath the banquet manager.
",-1,1
"Like it should be teams of people.
",-1,1
"One sixteen to be exact.
",-1,-1
"Um, and then we're planning for the next one which is this- No, next summer, which will be here in the DC area.
",-1,-1
"so like, uh, but there was- I need you not to be six and having Kain or I will  But it was good.
",-1,-1
"When I went back, Larra was the la- one of the last open space schools in DC to be converted to rooms.
",-1,-1
"She said, when you stand up there, you wait for everybody to be quiet.
",-1,-1
"This man getting ready to come out his grave and tell me to be quiet    and s- read somebody else's words.
",-1,-1
"Hope I ain't get nobody in trouble by saying this, but anyway, went there, and still had- but it was the place I was supposed to be.
",-1,-1
"Be.
",-1,1
"Be.
",-1,1
"Discipline, expression, pride, all of that was great, but I realize it was not gonna be my life.
",-1,-1
"I was gonna be - It was me and my little purple Bible that fell off the shelf and the Lord and we was gonna go save Wayman High School.
",-1,-1
"and inside, there will be a scripture at the top and a little message.
",-1,1
"I didn't w- I didn't- I didn't- as much as I grew up in the church, I didn't want to be churchy.
",-1,-1
"Cause you wanted to be the black Baptist trea- preacher but not really?
",-1,1
"and they need that to like, charge them whereas introverts, you can still be very- but at the end of the day you need to recharge by being alone.
",-1,1
"Like I can be Miss sunshine at the office, but when I go home, Mm-hm.
",-1,1
"And I tell the teachers a lot, um, okay, if we doing drop offs, then we need to go ahead and go now cause in about a hour, I don't need to be around people.
",-1,-1
"As now that- that meter's gonna be at zero and either, one, you're not gonna like me, um, or you probably not gonna like me.
",-1,-1
"Um, and I lost a little bit of my mind, got down and you know, for the first time you're able to be free and confront and do and oh, okay.
",-1,-1
"or whatever the case may be.
",-1,1
"you still gonna not lose weight or whatever it is that you want to do, you have- there has to be something deep down.
",-1,-1
"And if it's not where you gonna- where you don't wanna be, then leave.
",-1,-1
"Don't stay and be a blockade to the young person that needs you to listen Or a cancer.
",-1,-1
"And because he has an internship, uh, with Department of Energy, this is a little easier for him to be in DC.
",-1,-1
"And I don't know if that means I gotta- I got to be in a relationship with somebody that's in youth development, that gets it, or is in human services and gets it.
",-1,-1
"Um, especially cause you did go away to Baltimore, um, which I am realizing and I've learned that it is a very different world cause I'm thinking eight to forty five minutes away, well how different can they be?
",-1,-1
"Fifth grade year, uh, we were welcomed by Miss Darnell, who was a new teacher, but she would not be with us long because in her third week, Miss Paola decided that she wanted to curse at the fifth grade class of Estelle Elementary School, many of whom had been together since pre kindergarten and even at Tabernacle  across the street.
",-1,-1
"So I wanted to be able to live in the same place.
",-1,-1
"Like, is the Club kind of a neutral ground or is- is it like exclusively serving one- It used to be neutral.
",-1,-1
"We sat down- the la- the last- after the last game- that Saturday- that next day, Saturday morning, we sat down with Chick Fil A and talked about what it meant to be young black men in Southeast.
",-1,-1
"Um, what do you think is the perception or what does it mean to be a black male in ward eight?
",-1,-1
"Or not even just male- I won't even just say- but to be a black person in ward eight.
",-1,-1
"To be feared.
",-1,-1
"Oh- those- those- those kids, they- they must be going back to Anacostia.
",-1,-1
"I wasn't gonna- I wasn't gonna be professional about it, Mm.
",-1,-1
"Um, and the- sadly enough they had to prove that to some of the people that were in the environment and in the community, and what that meant to f- to them, to the young people who chose to come to the Club who had friends who didn't choose to come to the Club because they made other choices that were not always positive choices, and what that meant for them to stand up and say, yup, I'm gonna be different because that's what I wanna do.
",-1,-1
"That's who I choose to be.
",-1,1
"Um,  so, I mean, it- it's- it's this whole notion that to be from Southeast doesn't mean anything .
",-1,-1
"Let's- let's be all of that cause this is your space, and it's alright.
",-1,1
"Um, I don't know when that's gonna be  Um- You were gonna ask me what it is?
",-1,-1
"Could be cornstarch.
",-1,-1
"And I think- I mean- it- of course, like it- with anything, there's always going to be variations.
",-1,-1
"Um, but mumbo sauce had to be in the picture.
",-1,-1
"She asked you be quiet, and you didn't, Philippa  wham!
",-1,-1
"I tell you you hear a pin drop, and I mean you can- I can- to to this day I can hear, I told you be quiet!
