2083,-1,"And it might- it might- it might be deep.
"
2084,-1,"It might just be a journaling entry, how I'm feeling a certain day.
"
2085,-1,"It- Because- because I wanted to write, and I was like, I wanna be on the stage and say everything, say my- like, speak my words in front of people.
"
2086,-1,"Oh, um, My brother was aksed in a prompt the other day what he wanted to be when he grew up.
"
2087,-1,"I want to be alive.
"
2088,-1,"He just wants to be able to breathe the air that peo- that people play with so effortlessly.
"

"
2090,-1,"I looked at him, and I said, 'Man, you will be.'
"
2091,-1,"But I wonder if he could decode the Morse code in my voice saying, 'Dang, I wonder if you'll be alive, too.'
"
2092,-1,"Cause I was just helping him with his homework, and my man's like, I wanna be alive.
"
2093,-1,"Y- Go on Youtube or something like, that should not be what you're worrying about.
"
2094,-1,"Your life- You should be enjoying your life at this point in your life.

"
2096,-1,"Uh, I just wanted- I just wanted to be in the Club all the time.
"
2097,-1,"Do you feel like, um, just because- like, what made you feel like you had to be respectful?
"
2098,-1,"I got a lot of work in the eighth grade year cause my teacher wanted us to be prepared.
"
2099,-1,"And then springtime came around and lacrosse season was coming up, and they told me that I needed a three point O to be on the team, so I was like, alright cool and now I gotta get my grades up.
"
2100,-1,"I was like, oh this might be my sport.
"
2101,-1,"But if I manage to get a lacrosse scholarship, I wanna get that lacrosse scholarship and go and get sports medicine so I could be a personal trainer or fitness trainer.
"
2103,-1,"And I just wanted to be at the Club, that's all.

2104,-1,"So- so tell me why you wanna be at the Club.
"
2105,-1,"I didn't know it was gonna be so cold up there.
"
2106,-1,"Just be able to vent or talk about their problems, what's going on in society, especially what we h- the person we have in office.
"
2107,-1,"I would be gladly to lead that one.
"
2108,-1,"For black males I would say it is not the greatest place to be right now.
"
2109,-1,"Cause it seems like we're always on the news for doing something wrong, which I feel like statistically that shouldn't be possible.
"
2110,-1,"I'm not one to fight at all, but I get that you're mad but I feel like you should be able to speak it out first before leading the violence.
"
2111,-1,"I feel like I'm the person in the- even though things are dark nowadays, I'm the person that has to be the one to put a smile on everybody's face.
"
2112,-1,"So I keep a smile on my face So they could be happy as well.
"
2113,-1,"Because if you walk into a room and somebody's negative, they feel like it's their responsibility to be negative as well to make it- make it seem like, you should care about me, and not right- you right now cause I'm dealing with bigger problems than you.
"
2114,-1,"So I feel like, I should be the one to say, hey let's not think about our problems right now let's think about all the positive in life right now, if anything.
"
2115,-1,"So the other- So that's interesting because- So when you're not having a good day you're not wanting to be the positive person.
"
2116,-1,"Those days don't come cause I know I have to be happy, so.
"
2117,-1,"Uh, cause like I could come home and just have- like, I'll come home and just be tired and wanna go to sleep.
"
2118,-1,"And then they'll be like, hey let's go outside and play.
"
2120,-1,"I'll be like, alright I'll play for one hour.
"
2121,-1,"We'll be outside for like, three or four hours and not even notice it yet.
"
2122,-1,"I'm not- I don't have a problem with sleepovers whatever like, when y'all taking up the TV when I could be playing my game, and y'all not even watching the TV, that's annoying as well.
"
2123,-1,"And so it's-  it's a really- Um, I- I love video- I'm a- I used to be a Super Nintendo, well Nintendo, Super Nintendo Super Ninten-  Um, Nintendo sixty-four, like I was a Mario fan.
"
2124,-1,"I think it's- there's a very big diversity in DC, but I think the culture will be coming over when people come over as well.
"
2125,-1,"So I think there's gonna be a big culture change in the near future.
"
2126,-1,"I believe that when people come to DC they are coming for tourist destinations and DC is that place to be.
"
2127,-1,"where he would get the fastest rappers that he know, but they have to be clear.
"
2128,-1,"His metaphors and his similes will be out of this world.
"
2129,-1,"Be things that you would never even think of.
"
2130,-1,"Um, are you proud to be from DC?
"
2131,-1,"I'm very proud to be from DC.
"
2133,-1,"So, that's all I'm gonna be writing.
"
2134,-1,"It was one of those things where it's, you can go, but it won't be all the time.
"
2135,-1,"One girl was telling me about the gangs- No if they- If it was a neighborhood, it would be like- If the girls and boys from your neighborhood?
"
2136,-1,"That was just all over, like you could be from different places.
"
2137,-1,"Were you ever like, wanting to be in the gang?
"
2138,-1,"Or wanted to- You know, I'm gonna be in a gang?
"
2139,-1,"Fa- I would think because you are- You- You are very detail- So I would think blue would be higher.
"
2140,-1,"But your comment is on- Your comment is right, so I can't be mad.
"
2141,-1,"It had to be Addicted.
"
2142,-1,"And so, that's where I wanted to be, somewhere that was church affiliated, somewhere that was family orienated and small.
"
2143,-1,"I didn't want to be a number.
"
2144,-1,"That was the biggest Darien had seen in awhile because people wasn't really doing other things, and so once I became, it was like, oh everybody wanted to be in Gamma.
"
2145,-1,"What people fail to realize is that- And that's what we s- w- We was aksed to be a part of the Divine Nine.
"
2146,-1,"On campus it would have had to be the Sigmas, and it's this other um, Greek organization that's not Divine Nine, but New Zeta Epsilon.
"
2147,-1,"If you know- You have to learn how to be able to talk to people and stuff like that.
"
2148,-1,"But I don't feel like I had to go into social work to be in social work.
"
2152,-1,"A little bit youn- youn- Yep, cause my mom about to be forty next year.
"
2153,-1,"She's always- She said it, I had to be the principal today.
"
2154,-1,"You can be borderline ratchet.
"
2155,-1,"Because- And I'm gonna- And the reason- I'm asking you this for a reason, but I want to know specifically how was it  because you got to be a tourist, but then this guy's taking you into his house in- with- mean- his family, his neighborhood.
"
2156,-1,"So she should be fine, but I'm tryna get her to get out of just DC, so like she- Nothing wrong with her being in a group chat, but they- have like- the DMV Linked-In group chat.
"
2157,-1,"And so what do you feel- How do you feel as a local, do you take advantage of the touristy stuff, and then do you try to give your touristy people- Do you feel like you try to give them a local experience, and what would the local experience be?
"
2158,-1,"Because before I- like, was doing a re- I wanted to be a tour guide.
"
2159,-1,"And if you didn't live here, you would be - But you know what, we need to take ad- we ne- But I've also notice that it's way more to like,-then just the touristy stuff.
"
2160,-1,"So my granddad was like, that's going to be your sweet sixteen, like what better way can you do that?
"
2161,-1,"Like you're gonna be chauffeured everywhere you go.
"
2162,-1,"So I feel like, once he passed away in two thousand and eight, it was just like, Daddy wasn't gonna be around forever.
"
2163,-1,"Like, that was my- I said for-, it's my twenty fifth birthday, that year it was going to be for me to get my own place, get on my own.
"
2165,-1,"You know what I'm not gonna be mad at that.
"
2166,-1,"Like you really think that everything had to happen- You're like, that's not my way, it's just like- It's not gonna be anyway.
"
2167,-1,"And then so when I met my boyfriend in Ohio, he kind of like, shift things like, Well I might not can always be around.
"
2168,-1,"and realize, look, everything is not gonna be your way.
"
2169,-1,"Not gonna be handed to you.
"
2170,-1,"And so- And like, I would be the one that could leave out, go get my food from the truck.
"
2171,-1,"I really hate being hot, and I didn't think about no place could be so packed.
"
2172,-1,"You have to be ready for that.
"
2173,-1,"But I had my moments when I wanted let my hair down and I called it like, be ratchet.
"
2174,-1,"And so like-  When was your last be ratchet moment?
"
2175,-1,"And so m- It was AndAlika birthday- I started a mentoring program, so these are people that wanted to be mentors- So I introduced them to each other, even though I had other mentors that had applied we all went to dinner together.
"
2176,-1,"And then randomly, Brittany was like, I'm not gonna be able to go.
"
2177,-1,"I heard that her sister passed away, and we just need to go and be there for her.
"
2178,-1,"And then our last conversation with Pagan was about cops, like, sh- how she liked people in uniform, but it had to be a PG cop.
"
2179,-1,"Like did it have to be so- Did she have to lose half of her face?
"
2180,-1,"You should be next.
"
2182,-1,"I can't be on the train forever.
"
2184,-1,"Um, Fourth of July, we would be outside, literally until one o'clock in the morning cause we were so young, um, playing with my cousins, everything.
"
2185,-1,"Like I need to be that one to go further, to show her that it wasn't in vain basically.
"
2186,-1,"I definitely still wanna be a lawyer.
"
2187,-1,"Um, we had our issues with racism, but I was always raised to be strong minded, and don't worry about the fact that you got racist people everywhere, so.
"
2188,-1,"Um, so I guess that would be the extent of my Is your mother fair skinned?
"
2189,-1,"You need to be over there playing with them.
"
2190,-1,"Um, so always telling me, you know, you got to be a young lady, um, and to this day, I remember, and I tell people all the time.
"
2191,-1,"So, and I tell him all the time, you had no business talking to my mother, but I- I wouldn't be here if you didn't.
"
2192,-1,"At thirty five years of age, should not be living with my grandmother.
"
2193,-1,"Um, and that could be just going to the waff, um, going to um, just walk around.
"
2194,-1,"Um, and it depends on where y- where you're going on where you'll be accepted.
"
2195,-1,"And you know, telling them that I'm from DC, and it's- Once they got into the government, they never expected it to be like that.
"
2196,-1,"And it's like, literally, you can go one street over and be killed.
"
2197,-1,"So- And it- it's- And I- I always tell Mauri, you know if you're not from there, don't go where you're not supposed to be going.
"
2198,-1,"Be gone.
"
2199,-1,"You see the effects of the real life people, but you also see like, it could be a good thing.
"
2200,-1,"And I- And I- Reason why I say it could be a good thing because um, I went to Atlanta, Georgia in um, college for uh, s- uh, community service for a week.
"
2201,-1,"So I'm like, what could we be in those ten years, if we're able to clean up these projects, and clean them up the right way, Mm.
"
2202,-1,"And so many intelligent people, because m- And I mean, it may just be me, but my father's line, you know- We have intelligent people in our family, very very intelligent people.
"
2203,-1,"Could be on the streets selling herself for all I know.
"
2204,-1,"And I had to be brought back out the bubble once I was old enough to understand.
"
2205,-1,"Next week will be good.
"
2206,-1,"No, Monday I'll be at a conference.
"
2207,-1,"And she had us at a early age, so Adan's about to be sixteen.
"
2208,-1,"He can't- a woman shouldn't be doing that.
"
2209,-1,"A woman should be at home taking- like, that's why I said my mother's a stay at home mom.
"
2210,-1,"She should be at home taking care of her children, so they're having that little crisis right now, and he's resorting to more and more alcohol.
"
2211,-1,"Cause you had to be the older sibling even though you weren't the oldest.
"
2212,-1,"Um, I had to be the oldest.
"
2213,-1,"Mm- That'd be great.
"
2214,-1,"I thought we were gonna be like, and they were born in DC,  Nah, I'm not sure.
"
2215,-1,"Um, to be honest with you, it wasn't that bad because my sisters are way older than me.
"
2216,-1,"Like it would be gunshots right outside my backyard.
"
2217,-1,"Just- To be honest with you, just being with my friends.
"
2218,-1,"We- Uh, I don't have one specific memory to be truthfully honest with you.
"
2219,-1,"And my mother said, no, you're not gonna be with your friends no more.
"
2220,-1,"I could be watching you on TV.
"
2221,-1,"So, I- I- I ain't gon- To be honest with you, I don't like to think about high school because I was so miserable throughout the whole four years.
"
2222,-1,"And the rest of the people I don't- I don't really wanna be associated with none of the people that went to that school.
"
2223,-1,"And I- I- I wasn't familiar with the Georgetowns or the- the George Washington- I weren't familiar with those areas, so I would just be on Georgia Avenue, Fourteenth Street, U Street, uh, those areas on down.
"
2224,-1,"I think it'll be nice.
"
2225,-1,"When I got to college, I wanted to be in college.
"
2226,-1,"I wanted to know what it was like to go to school around white people and be around white people, and I wanted- And it was in the mountains, so I wanted somewhere where I could study and h- it didn't have any distractions.
"
2227,-1,"I'm not sure to be truthfully honest with you.
"
2228,-1,"Other than that, I will always be in Southeast.
"
2229,-1,"I need to go be a tourist.
"
2230,-1,"Well of course it would have to be Martin Luther King.
"
2231,-1,"I s- I studied Abraham Lincoln, so it's- it's nothing you can aks me that I wouldn't be an answer.
"
2232,-1,"Actually I wouldn't be able to ask you much cause I'm not very knowledgable.
"
2233,-1,"So what do you think you- What- If you had to say, that's my dream job, what would that be?
"
2234,-1,"To be engineer, a mechanical engineer.
"
2235,-1,"Like, it c- it could be a plane engine, boat engine.
"
2236,-1,"I'll be looking out for your name.
"
2237,-1,"I have no reason to be in Virginia.
"
2238,-1,"To be honest with you, I never kn- I never really knew about Virginia until I w- started working in Virginia.
"
2239,-1,"If you could leave one piece of advice to- to young black men, but also just to the youth in general, what would that piece of advice be?
"
2240,-1,"Just try not to fall into the trap of You have to be a certain way.
"
2241,-1,"Just be yourself.
"
2242,-1,"So that's how my mentality is not, I need to be like this.
"
2243,-1,"So, I w- I would just try to tell them to try to- Because- If you- Growing up in that environment and growing up around those people, you can't help but wanna be like that.
"
2244,-1,"So th- I- That's- That would be my advice.
"
2245,-1,"I just think that would be difficult because that person has to want to do it.
"
2246,-1,"Her name was supposed to be Christin, and I'm still salty about that.
"
2247,-1,"be quiet, get it together.
"
2248,-1,"So I read it to just try to get my mind to focus on other things and try to be calm- calm and well mannered instead of being stressed.
"
2249,-1,"I don't really have a favorite anything, but of course my favorite TV show right now will have to be Power.
"
2250,-1,"would have to be Power.
"
2251,-1,"anything Chinese felated would always be the carry out.
"
2252,-1,"That's why I said gentrification would be good cause we- they can give us these restaurants so we don't have to keep eating this junk food.
"
2253,-1,"I would be in the party while people was partying to it, listening to go go.
"
2254,-1,"Uh, that- that would be it, looking at the girls dance to g- to go go.
"
2255,-1,"I might be off a year or two.
"
2256,-1,"And after the class of ninety-eight, they went back to going to neighborhood schools because it was difficult for parents to be active in the schools because they were so far.
"
2257,-1,"which was good because it allowed us to be kind of interactive in the schools as a community and also for the parents.
"
2258,-1,"In high school I was very mature, what defined me was I think my ability to kind of be a chameleon Mm-hm.
"
2259,-1,"And my new nickname for DC is diversity city because it's so much diversity in DC where as it used to be predominantly African American in a lot of areas in DC.
"
2260,-1,"Just to be a part of that change where it's kind of like a new breath is being breathe into the body of DC, so.
"
2261,-1,"Union Station was the spot to be  when I was younger.
"
2262,-1,"to kind of spice it up, you know, so people would not be like- Cause me, I wouldn't know their music.
"
2263,-1,"Cause that can be mm, you know.
"
2264,-1,"Because as the oldest I just felt so responsible to come back and kind of be a leader to my younger siblings.
"
2265,-1,"And then also to just show them that you can come from very humble beginnings but that doesn't mean that you have to be a product of your environment.
"
2266,-1,"Or you can get married, you don't have to just be, you know, a baby's mama.
"
2267,-1,"You know, you can be a wife.
"
2268,-1,"You can  you can be a business owner.
"
2269,-1,"Um, and I want- I wanna say this was challenging and rewarding, this is gonna be both.
"
2270,-1,"I'm thinking that, hey Tymeka you're smart, you know, it's online, it'll be easy.
"
2271,-1,"So is this your- um, I know you said you love your job, is this your be all end all?
"
2272,-1,"I can't say what my- I would love to be  actually.
"
2273,-1,"To be a CEO.
"
2274,-1,"I actually would like to be more involved on the program side, um, as well as, you know, the support.
"
2275,-1,"But I would also like to be more involved with the kids.
"
2276,-1,"Um, so if I could have a position here where I kind of touched on all of those- all of those- all of those pieces at once, I think that that'd be the ideal position for me.
"
2277,-1,"inaudible And it's gonna be there, on every job description.
"
2278,-1,"Because that's- that's gonna be - Know that.
"
2279,-1,"This gonna be your major bullet point right here, this is what we want you to do.
"
2280,-1,"and I don't want to- that- I want to be at a place where I'm communicating effectively.
"
2281,-1,"Or where, you know, I may have a strength and that's your weakness that we can work together and team together, you know what I'm saying, to- to- to make that be your strength as well.
"
2282,-1,"And like I said that would be one area that I can say I am lacking in.
"
2283,-1,"And I don't think that at this point, the point where I am now I'm doing that as effectively as I should be.
"
2284,-1,"So I'm gonna go to one of their meetings in February and just kind of see what it's all about and if it's something that would be helpful to me, but.
"
2285,-1,"We'll- I'll be in the office all day.
"
2286,-1,"And that'll be our first piece.
"
2287,-1,"And she just started crying and she's like, this'll be my last vote- time voting, I'm sure.
"
2288,-1,"And I have my fingers crossed, I say it every season, this is gonna be our year.
"
2289,-1,"So I'm gonna say that again, this is gonna be our year.
"
2290,-1,"Yup, it- whichever way it goes, I'm- I'm'a be a Redskin fan for life.
"
2291,-1,"I started my own business, it'll be four years in January.
"
2292,-1,"And I liked it, but I- I just wanted to be more hands on in the planning part of it.
"
2293,-1,"Um, she came to me and it was like maybe like four months before her wedding and she was just like, I know  it's gonna be good but I don't think it's gonna come together like I i- like I have it in my mind.
"
2294,-1,"I tell people- I also do Lyft part time, so I tell, um, gentrifiers, as they're called, when they get in my vehicle, um, when they aks me about DC, I say, if you hear the name of your street mentioned in a- a- a old go go song, just know your neighborhood used to be hood.
"
2295,-1,"It w- it was a big deal to be from DC back in the day.
"
2296,-1,"So it kind of gave me perspective, um, knowing that there was something else out there, not to be limited to just what I saw around me.
"
2297,-1,"So we would just be out, um, walking around through Alexandria.
"
2298,-1,"Because now PG County, it was starting to grow with this DC influence so it was like a new mix, um, of- of just what it was to be from DC, it was like- And- and honestly, my uncle- and h- there's a- there's a article online, my uncle- I have that uncle that swear he came up with the phrase DMV.
"
2299,-1,"And you know the U Street crowd and the Adams Morgan vibe when it- when it w- used to be just like a bunch of people standing around, saying hey, having fun, drinking.
"
2300,-1,"we would go grab us, um, a couple of outfits, and then we would figure out what we was gonna wear that weekend, and we would be out every weekend.
"
2301,-1,"You could be standing next to somebody that just like, owns half the daggone block and you're just standing there next to them at Panera just getting a sandwich.
"
2302,-1,"If I am from anywhere else in the world, and I come to the city that's supposed to be the city that houses the leader of the free world, I don't wanna see no homeless guy pissing on the corner.
"
2303,-1,"Like I think DC needed to be cleaned up, like honest to goodness, like it just- it just needed like a facelift.
"
2304,-1,"with the money to spend that should soon be getting married after they live this life in the city and they decide they're ready to settle down.
"
2305,-1,"You would be building long term things not short term spaces.
"
2306,-1,"Cause it- it can be taught.
"
2307,-1,"Like I feel like with entrepreneurship we can start to shift the balance because the whole slave thing, well, we need people to be slaves.
"
2308,-1,"There are some, but there are not as many as there need to be.
"
2309,-1,"And it's not as much as a push as there should be for like actually focusing on, okay- You know, what's done is done.
"
2310,-1,"Y'all can f- forget about getting whatever y'all want back, because they gonna slap so many zeros behind that tag, it's r- it's gonna be ridiculous.
"
2311,-1,"I don't think that's safe, I don't think there should be a building up there.
"
2312,-1,"And it's gonna be that way for a while because they figured out what works.
"
2313,-1,"Just like, you know, suburban, like they can still walk, you know, home and ride their bikes to work and th- you know, go out and have a good time and, you know, still be safe and, you know.
"
2314,-1,"I think they are trying to, But I think even if they put all the buildings that they wanted up, and they did everything they could to kind of make it this new, shiny space, east of the river has a disconnect from the rest of the city so it's never gonna quite be like downtown or uptown or anything like that.
"
2315,-1,"And even just the fact that everything that's around east of the river it's it's still gonna be those people.
"
2316,-1,"You have to approach it with I know stuff but it could be wrong.
"
2317,-1,"Like, if you talk to anyone, and this could be black or white, they know that, okay, in Virginia, you may get pulled over for less and held for more.
"
2318,-1,"Versus driving in DC, whereas you have to be doing something almost extreme for them to really mess with you.
"
2319,-1,"So if I say, police are press in- press in Virginia, they're like- you know, somebody from the outside must be like, oh wow maybe cause that's a predominantly white area, you think police are more likely to pull you over cause you're black in Virginia.
"
2320,-1,"Like you gotta go to like a regional park like it's gonna be like a county park or a state park just to get a trail to go jog if you wanted to.
"
2321,-1,"It's- it's cool because again, I'm one of those people that need freedom, I need to be able to do it when I want to, so it's good for me.
"
2322,-1,"And so when you meet somebody who's from DC or even from this area that grew up in this area, wait I didn't think there was anybody from here, so now li- like, there must be a story.
"
2323,-1,"So when you have those two things coming together, like, oh my g- there has to be some amazing crazy story that happened to you.
"
2324,-1,"Did you- You know, I mean, like it has to be something crazy, like, right?
"
2325,-1,"Um, decided that, you know, the way that it was set up she wasn't gonna be able to do her job as expected because the kitchen was too far from the tent.
"
2326,-1,"So she wanted the bride to pay for another tent so that she could have her own tent to be set up in.
"
2327,-1,"But regardless, she- the bride paid for a tent so that the caterer could be closer to the- to the actual tent that the reception was in.
"
2328,-1,"She's like, oh, no I'm not doing that, if I do it it's gonna be another hun- two hundred and fifty dollars.
"
2329,-1,"She's supposed to be blissfully blind the entire day so that even if stuff does go wrong, she don't know about it.
"
2330,-1,"Maybe you shouldn't be in this business, lady.
"
2331,-1,"But there should be some s- other people underneath the chef and other people underneath the banquet manager.
"
2332,-1,"Like it should be teams of people.
"
2333,-1,"One sixteen to be exact.
"
2334,-1,"Um, and then we're planning for the next one which is this- No, next summer, which will be here in the DC area.
"
2335,-1,"so like, uh, but there was- I need you not to be six and having Kain or I will  But it was good.
"
2336,-1,"When I went back, Larra was the la- one of the last open space schools in DC to be converted to rooms.
"
2337,-1,"She said, when you stand up there, you wait for everybody to be quiet.
"
2338,-1,"This man getting ready to come out his grave and tell me to be quiet    and s- read somebody else's words.
"
2339,-1,"Hope I ain't get nobody in trouble by saying this, but anyway, went there, and still had- but it was the place I was supposed to be.
"
2340,-1,"Be.
"
2341,-1,"Be.
"
2342,-1,"Discipline, expression, pride, all of that was great, but I realize it was not gonna be my life.
"
2343,-1,"I was gonna be - It was me and my little purple Bible that fell off the shelf and the Lord and we was gonna go save Wayman High School.
"
2344,-1,"and inside, there will be a scripture at the top and a little message.
"
2345,-1,"I didn't w- I didn't- I didn't- as much as I grew up in the church, I didn't want to be churchy.
"
2346,-1,"Cause you wanted to be the black Baptist trea- preacher but not really?
"
2347,-1,"and they need that to like, charge them whereas introverts, you can still be very- but at the end of the day you need to recharge by being alone.
"
2348,-1,"Like I can be Miss sunshine at the office, but when I go home, Mm-hm.
"
2349,-1,"And I tell the teachers a lot, um, okay, if we doing drop offs, then we need to go ahead and go now cause in about a hour, I don't need to be around people.
"
2350,-1,"As now that- that meter's gonna be at zero and either, one, you're not gonna like me, um, or you probably not gonna like me.
"
2351,-1,"Um, and I lost a little bit of my mind, got down and you know, for the first time you're able to be free and confront and do and oh, okay.
"
2352,-1,"or whatever the case may be.
"
2353,-1,"you still gonna not lose weight or whatever it is that you want to do, you have- there has to be something deep down.
"
2354,-1,"And if it's not where you gonna- where you don't wanna be, then leave.
"
2355,-1,"Don't stay and be a blockade to the young person that needs you to listen Or a cancer.
"
2356,-1,"And because he has an internship, uh, with Department of Energy, this is a little easier for him to be in DC.
"
2357,-1,"And I don't know if that means I gotta- I got to be in a relationship with somebody that's in youth development, that gets it, or is in human services and gets it.
"
2358,-1,"Um, especially cause you did go away to Baltimore, um, which I am realizing and I've learned that it is a very different world cause I'm thinking eight to forty five minutes away, well how different can they be?
"
2359,-1,"Fifth grade year, uh, we were welcomed by Miss Darnell, who was a new teacher, but she would not be with us long because in her third week, Miss Paola decided that she wanted to curse at the fifth grade class of Estelle Elementary School, many of whom had been together since pre kindergarten and even at Tabernacle  across the street.
"
2360,-1,"So I wanted to be able to live in the same place.
"
2361,-1,"Like, is the Club kind of a neutral ground or is- is it like exclusively serving one- It used to be neutral.
"
2362,-1,"We sat down- the la- the last- after the last game- that Saturday- that next day, Saturday morning, we sat down with Chick Fil A and talked about what it meant to be young black men in Southeast.
"
2363,-1,"Um, what do you think is the perception or what does it mean to be a black male in ward eight?
"
2364,-1,"Or not even just male- I won't even just say- but to be a black person in ward eight.
"
2365,-1,"To be feared.
"
2366,-1,"Oh- those- those- those kids, they- they must be going back to Anacostia.
"
2367,-1,"I wasn't gonna- I wasn't gonna be professional about it, Mm.
"
2368,-1,"Um, and the- sadly enough they had to prove that to some of the people that were in the environment and in the community, and what that meant to f- to them, to the young people who chose to come to the Club who had friends who didn't choose to come to the Club because they made other choices that were not always positive choices, and what that meant for them to stand up and say, yup, I'm gonna be different because that's what I wanna do.
"
2369,-1,"That's who I choose to be.
"
2370,-1,"Um,  so, I mean, it- it's- it's this whole notion that to be from Southeast doesn't mean anything .
"
2371,-1,"Let's- let's be all of that cause this is your space, and it's alright.
"
2372,-1,"Um, I don't know when that's gonna be  Um- You were gonna ask me what it is?
"
2373,-1,"Could be cornstarch.
"
2374,-1,"And I think- I mean- it- of course, like it- with anything, there's always going to be variations.
"
2375,-1,"Um, but mumbo sauce had to be in the picture.
"
2376,-1,"She asked you be quiet, and you didn't, Philippa  wham!
"
2377,-1,"I tell you you hear a pin drop, and I mean you can- I can- to to this day I can hear, I told you be quiet!
"
5501,1,"you be saying um, my daughter mother jack to wash our clothes.
