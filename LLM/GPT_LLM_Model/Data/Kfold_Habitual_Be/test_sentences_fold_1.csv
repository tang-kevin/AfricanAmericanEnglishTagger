"
207,-1,"Man, what- how d- what i- what i- what- I don't know, where did the wisdom come from, to where you can be like, you know what, I'm'a help this guy at times.
"
208,1,"I be on that bougie shit- Ay nigga, I'm letting you know, I'm packing these bitches.
"
209,-1,"Have you, um, encountered any, um, I guess people within the- the music business that you felt like you had that type of relationship with, and then, um, I guess you, um, came to the realization that that might not actually be the case stuff from  Could you repeat that question one more time?
"
210,-1,"in the music industry business-wise you've worked with that, um, you felt like you've compensated them or you're- you know, you're willing to compensate them now to, um, be compensated later on in the future, and I guess maybe the opportunity came around and that didn't, um, come across as such or whatever?
"
211,-1,"But takes a lot of planning and a lot of people to be on board to try to pull that off, and, you know, who really cares about trying to go to them type of things now and stuff.
"
212,-1,"That'll probably be so lit too.
"
213,-1,"I- I give you that, you know, your own inclination whatever that be, so you're a god.
"
214,-1,"But I don't wanna be that type of dad.
"
215,-1,"I wanna be able to fully develop some time into my kids.
"
216,1,"And I be thinking like, damn, maybe I gotta get on this bitch just so I can give that type of answer because it's some real niggas out here, and I don't- some of this stuff, I don't see represents me thoroughly I would say, especially when it comes to some of these Atlanta rappers' mindsets.
"
217,-1,"You never, um, thought that, um, coming across too smart might, um, enable you or s- be to your detriment of your music career?
"
218,-1,"All the scenari- whatever it might be, I'm'a- I'm'a try to keep it real with you as- as one thousand as possible.
"
219,-1,"I can't let they feelings be my feelings.
"
220,1,"God be on that happened to my family, you know what I'm saying, but at the same time, they know I'm on a mission not just for me but for them as well, Mm.
"
221,1,"Damn, so, uh, um,  doing the music shit, do you feel like you be, um, at times I guess too focused on that and then you forget about I guess your personal relationships with your family or whoever, friends, anything like that?
"
222,-1,"Got a new single I been- I mean, it's kind of obvious what it's gonna be called.
"
223,-1,"I- I'm'a- I'm'a always be relevant long as I walk around with that sign.
"
224,-1,"Ooh, I'm always gonna be relevant.
"
225,-1,"inaudible one and two or two and one, however that may be the one two punch, you know what I'm saying.
"
226,-1,"I'm'a have my opportunity when it come, I'm'a be - probably go longer than Drake as far as number one hits Mm-hm.
"
227,-1,"I haven't been able to be in the studio twenty-four hours back to back to back, It hasn't happened yet.
"
228,-1,"But to learn yourself to just be in there and just learn yourself, man, that's a whole different- Woo hoo hoo.
"
229,-1,"I don't think nobody gonna be touching me then.
"
230,-1,"So when I really get that- a team that work just as hard as me all across the board, it's gonna be even more dangerous.
"
231,-1,"Just off your words alone, what would you feel need to be, I guess mandatory in your dro- n- when you drop the sign or whatever?
"
232,-1,"You just gotta be ready.
"
233,-1,"And it's almost like when you- when you- when it's really your time, you gotta- y- you gonna be scared a little bit cause it's a lot that come with that, you know what I'm saying.
"
234,-1,"Gotta be out there, man.
"
235,-1,"I ain't gonna lie, man, you gotta be a certain type of ivi- individual to really- really not dim your light and keep- cause that sign is really crushing all the indie promotion-wise for a bunch of different shit, you know, and you consistent with it, you know, and you gonna stand out.
"
236,1,"Like a lot of times I don't even be wanting to step out the house cause I feel like, oh shit, I'm- I'm losing more than I'm gaining, gas, money, and just being out, god damn probably gonna have to pay for some drinks, food, gas, some of everything, you know, just kick it with folks, but shit, you got your name.
"
237,-1,"You in the place to be even just walking down the street.
"
238,-1,"I mean, you can but you wouldn't be too successful with it.
"
239,-1,"They don't want a Black man to ever be able to reach Mm-hm.
"
240,-1,"It's a little funky right now, but, you know, they gonna be testing soon.
"
241,-1,"It's gonna be some more talent.
"
242,-1,"Um, I'm probably gonna be segueing to a bunch of different stuff if that's cool with you.
"
243,1,"That's- that's very very interesting cause I be feeling that way sometimes personally just from my life like, dang, maybe like almost ten, twenty years ago, things looked totally different than the way they look kind of right now.
"
244,-1,"My parents are divorced, so of course I can't ask questions that- for them to be together so much.
"
245,-1,"um, so it was close enough where I could get there in a short amount of time, but it wasn't- that wasn't my school I was supposed to be in.
"
246,1,"I- a lot of people just be like, oh yeah, I just took the cheese bus.
"
247,-1,"But when we were outside in middle school and stuff- I mean, when we were in middle school, you know, you could just be outside, and you could find anything from playing a sport to kicking it on somebody's porch to doing a billion things.
"
248,-1,"Um, I just think the person may be more a little different versus the way they talk.
"
249,-1,"Um, the west side do kind of got a real slang, hood very like, uh, real h- typical African American stereotyped would of a Black man would be in Atlanta.
"
250,-1,"When I go out of town, or if I'm just around certain people, they might be like, where you from?
"
251,-1,"Like your art gotta be bigger than that.
"
252,-1,"Do you feel like, um, the influence of the music alone is affecting, you know, the people around in the area that talk this way, or do you think it's the people around this area talking of- this way that affected the music to be in that type of space?
"
253,-1,"I will say that words are very powerful, um, and especially in African American culture, um, we tend to-  we tend to move towards people who give strong words, um, whether it be a Martin Luther King, a Malcolm X, a President Obama, a Future, um, whoev- if- if y- if- if we can feel your words, that's kind of where the group of the people go from even Earth, Wind and Fire.
"
254,-1,"So if you go out one night, you- you listening to s- music the next night, you on Instagram the next night, and, uh, you done went out let's say a night after that as well too, and then the other night you was working, and you was listening to the radio, and every single night, you heard w- it just happened to be one song in particular, um, you're gonna constantl- that song is gonna get stuck with you regardless of how- Mm-hm.
"
255,-1,"S- Right, and- and I mean it's- it's t- it's probably gonna be like that.
"
256,-1,"Um, a lot of- a l- you have to kind of still be hip hop.
"
257,-1,"After so long, you gonna be like, hey, you know what?
"
258,-1,"And a lot of things folks gotta understand, you feel what I'm saying, that yes, i- if we don't spen- if we don't spend our own dollar back, it doesn't matter how much money we spend with the other folks because eventually we will be wiped out.
"
259,-1,"And I mean from what I seen, it- it looks to be true I mean I guess I don't know.
"
260,-1,"So who's to say why can't that be on every Black business?
"
261,-1,"I'm the guy that's gonna be interviewi- iewing today.
"
262,-1,"Right now I'm working at Mariaisabel which is to be changed soon, I'm looking to start working in the field of makeup, something that I love, so, yeah.
"
263,-1,"Hair, I really love doing hair, but I feel like, um, a lot of people does hair, so it's good to be multifaceted.
"
264,-1,"Because I feel like a friend is somebody that you should be able to call on and rely on in like the toughest times of your life, and if it's only for me to just party with you, um, yeah not- that's not gonna happen.
"
265,-1,"Like I need you to  be somebody that, um, I could learn from and you could learn from me and you actually tell me about my mistakes and I tell you about your mistakes.
"
266,-1,"So it would be like, me and my mom and then my aunt and her daughter and two sons and her husband.
"
267,-1,"But I want us to be closer.
"
268,-1,"And just teach our kids to be loving towards one another as brother and sister.
"
269,-1,"But I'm gonna teach them to be a little softer and nicer with each other.
"
270,-1,"Um, you need your car to go past the outside of your- your area, whatever that might be.
"
271,-1,"And you not gonna be get caught dead going in certain stores.
"
272,-1,"Even if we didn't want to be, that's just the way that it's built.
"
273,-1,"But he really, um, motivated us to be good people.
"
274,-1,"And then he'll be mad that I didn't turn in my work and stuff like that.
"
275,-1,"than to be focused on my craft.
"
276,-1,"So would that be considered I'm- I know that's a course, but it- was there any other extracurricular activities in school?
"
277,-1,"And, um, I cling to anything that's- that I feel comfortable with, so whether that be my mom, my sister, somebody close.
"
278,-1,"So it just depends on, for me, energy and where your, um, opinions, lie, like I'm not gonna not be your friend because you want a guy with money or whatever.
"
279,-1,"And, um, a lot of guys would walk through and be like, oh what's happening, shawty?
"
280,-1,"Okay, mic seems to be picking you up well.
"
281,-1,"But twenty-three years in Atlanta, it must be some good things about it.
"
282,-1,"And I'm doing Intellipaths which are questions on the politics, and I would rather be doing anything else.
"
283,-1,"Not so much as religion, but I'll say I'm big on believers cause I go according to the bible, and the bible says don't be overly religious.
"
284,-1,"Okay, do you ever at any point in time feel music wise y- you would be at a much, um, more mainstream success appeal if you had a different type of character than the one you have now?
"
285,-1,"And it kind of caused me to be stagnant or deal with jealous people or put other people on the forefront because I tend to have a big heart.
"
286,-1,"I believe that God is my only judge, but because I am a believer, it keeps me from getting caught up in selling my soul or doing anything just to get higher on the music Richter scale I guess would be the good word.
"
287,-1,"Yeah, you should be able to remember that quicker than m- I can remember the middle school joint.
"
288,-1,"yeah it's a lot of training in that, and a lot of times you gotta be real muscular.
"
289,1,"Um, I'm thinking some of these strippers out here, really be getting doctor money out here.
"
290,-1,"yeah, they may, but they're doing a little bit more than stripping, or exotic dancing would be the technical term.
"
291,-1,"I can't- I can't say if it's true or if it's not true, but I wouldn't be, you know, attacking him like it is true.
"
292,-1,"I personally think the powers that be could have enough power to pull that off and have the media, you know, convince us, whatever.
"
293,-1,"Cause it could be, know- you know, one percenters, or the whoever else.
"
294,-1,"I think it's definitely something to be enjoyed as much as possible, though.
"
295,-1,"That's really the best thing you could be.
"
296,-1,"Nah you s- you try to be funny and dip out right now.
"
297,-1,"If you kept actually trying to edit, you probably would be a lot better at editing.
"
298,-1,"Oh man, they want us to be turnt but not too turnt.
"
299,-1,"I don't think they want us to be turnt at all unless we're gay.
"
300,-1,"Nah, n- Uh, nah, nah it's a new world and- but, you know, it's- it's cool to not be PC about everything all the time and stuff.
"
301,-1,"This gotta be a spoof.
"
302,-1,"To be able to like, um, multitask and do all these different things.
"
303,-1,"No,  think whoever puts in the most effort would be the ones that get it.
"
304,-1,"I think it's cause you almost look like you could be from New Orleans or something.
"
305,-1,"Definitely where, you know, you can be who you want to.
"
306,1,"Yeah, they be taking giant shits.
"
307,-1,"Mm, I find that to be not true.
"
308,-1,"Now this gonna be a- a kind of different type of interview.
"
309,-1,"It's gonna be a lot of free styling, but I got in mind how I wanna conceptually wrap this up.
"
310,-1,"We gonna be speaking for briefly forty-five minutes or so.
"
311,-1,"You know what I'm saying, if your body was really perf- perfected, you wo- you shouldn't be getting sick, period.
"
312,-1,"So do you feel like the equivalant of us like jumping out of a fish tank, we would just be flapping on the ground of the floor, o- of the fish tank or some shit.
"
313,-1,"A virus is in here changing the software, doing stuff that it ain't supposed to be doing to us.
"
314,-1,"Don't need no friends, don't need no toys, just could- m- m- play and just be happy.
"
315,-1,"But truly, you know, if it was, you know, just focused on that, it would be no problem.
"
316,-1,"They could just say something to 'em- somebody, and they'd be in a trance.
"
317,-1,"I remember you saying that and, um  try not to be indecisive.
"
318,-1,"Ah, I want to say something like the blavity or something, but it might not be that.
"
319,-1,"It might be something else, the ship.
"
320,1,"When you starting to freeze, your body's systems will slow way down and some people be frozen all the way solid, Mm-hm.
"
321,-1,"and then thaw out and be f- perfectly fine.
"
322,-1,"So your body's supposed to be crystal.
"
323,-1,"And be like, yo, water helped  make this limestone, like been dripping for a thousand years, and now it made these huge stalactites that's in this cave.
"
324,-1,"You could pour- I could pour a sludge in that shit right now and fucking put that shit in the sun and the moon and it's still gonna be sludge in that shit in the morning.
"
325,-1,"It gotta be pure.
"
326,-1,"It's gotta be pu- it's hard to keep water pure because we in such a fucking riddled virus environment.
"
327,-1,"And be able to fight the vampires head up.
"
328,-1,"Oh the thing with the ship though, they built it to be an ish- indestructible ship.
"
329,-1,"If you away from our sun and you away from our earth, how would you be able to keep track of time?
"
330,1,"I mean, I know some a- some hard dudes and soon as the cops come around,  they be like, don't look to the side.
"
331,-1,"I'm just like, dog, just be - e- I mean, you're not a criminal.
"
332,-1,"Yeah but sometimes, you don't gotta be.
"
333,1,"That's how I be tryna go in this situation.
"
334,1,"Nah that's good, you be keeping good company.
"
335,-1,"That would be worse than what they're wearing now?
"
336,-1,"Nah, this gotta be on google.
"
337,-1,"This gotta be on google.
"
338,1,"Nah, they be into old school like Celia Cruz.
"
339,-1,"Benjamin West, who was one of the early American fine artists, said he was taught how to make paint as a child by a Native American friend who showed him how paint could be made by mixing clay with bear grease.
"
340,1,"Like I be correcting my kids so much just on common sense stuff.
"
341,-1,"Like, won't you just do this, and it just be the simplest thing?
"
342,-1,"It's gotta be this technology.
"
343,1,"Man, I know   Like I just be here trying to keep my brain so my body don't fall apart, cause that's all it's doing.
"
344,-1,"Your brain frequency supposed to be at ninety-seven point five And then that damn AC hit that shit, and that shit turns it down to ninety-seven point three.
"
345,-1,"We could- we coulda made pl- this a- be a great home for plants.
"
346,-1,"We can't be animals.
"
347,1,"Like, some people e- live like that that, but they be real Oh man.
"
348,-1,"They might be thick and may look, you know, husky and big boned, or what- you know, quote unquote big boned.
"
349,1,"Them niggas be unhealthy.
"
350,-1,"My father wasn't really around to be honest.
"
351,-1,"you know, but- but, you know, um, you know, we allow life to be life, you know, hm, and I just- I pretty much dealt with wha- what was given to me.
"
352,-1,"always had to be in the girl's face, you know what I'm saying.
"
353,-1,"It might be a piece of a high hat stand.
"
354,-1,"This little drum throne would be broke as fuck.
"
355,-1,"The snare would be broke as fuck.
"
356,-1,"Like the marching band would be in there practicing choral and orchestra music, and I'm sitting in there.
"
357,-1,"I wanted to be different.
"
358,-1,"You just wanted to be different.
"
359,-1,"I felt like the things in school were- not to be like a Black Panther or anything, but I felt like the knowledge that they was giving us  Mm-hm.
"
360,-1,"The change might be seven, eight bucks.
"
361,-1,"He's gonna be around for- he's definitely one of the ones, man.
"
362,-1,"Kendrick's records, top two would be Rigamortus Mm-hm.
"
363,-1,"you can p- I'll go on the record saying that real shit, you know what I'm saying, just to be a part of that movement, man.
"
364,-1,"He was- he really should be in the greatest of all time category.
"
365,-1,"I shouldn't be sharing my knowledge and my jewels of how I listen to music, but, you know what I'm saying, maybe it'll help somebody else, open 'em up,  you know what I'm saying.
"
366,-1,"I- you'd be surprised.
"
367,1,"porn be real.

369,1,"You be watching the, um, show Everyday Struggle?
"
370,-1,"Yeah, but lowkey he need to be embracing that shit, you know what I'm saying.
"
371,-1,"So I stress that, you know what I'm saying, I'm not even saying I've arrived, cause I- y'all talking to me right now as a nobody, but I promise you the next time we do a interview, I'll be a somebody.
"
372,-1,"and I don't want my image to be tainted or reflected, you know what I'm saying, in such a way.
"
373,-1,"My thought personally in that- I'll be straight, if you had your own platform big enough that like, ay okay, I see what y'all saying.
"
374,-1,"The thing is they want us to be monkeys, and they want us- They want that shit.

"
378,-1,"I'm- I'm more concerned about where my accounts gonna be, where I'm making investments.
"
379,-1,"Again, next time you talk to me and we may have a interview, may be me teaching a master class on production, you know what I'm saying.
"
