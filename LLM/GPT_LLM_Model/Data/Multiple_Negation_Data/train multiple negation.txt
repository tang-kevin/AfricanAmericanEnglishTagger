But these guys teach us that as a team; you can make great accomplishments; but individually you can make accomplishment but it's not bringing nobody up with you.,1

Me and Shyna; we try not to phone call no one; for the simple fact--when I call you; just say if I call you and say; well; I want to come talk to you about a union.,1

Wasn't nothing good about it but we made it.,1
Well; we--just to be honest with you; I believe too many people is really scared to come over here on McLaurin Street; but if you come over here on McLaurin Street; you don't feel nothing, 1

When we got on Guam; the tents didn't have no steps; that step up off the ground into the tent.,1
But now; I didn't want to go in there; but now I wouldn't be nowhere's else but a Marine.,1
If that's what we want and that's what someone tell us; and if we don't know no better; than that's all we think is good out there for us.,1
No; I was mainly concentrating on food service; I didn't get into no politics or nothing like that.,1
But; I ain't seen nobody but two people I was in there with since I got out of there.,1
When I come up; you couldn't be nothing but a ply hand.,1
That's the philosophy of basketball; ain't no other way.,1

We had to be on our ; she didn't tolerate no foolishness.,1
First of all; I think it's harder to teach kids because some of them from broken homes; some of 'em come from parents that did not give them a fine upbringing; some of 'em come from parents that didn't teach them right from wrong; and some of 'em didn't have no religious background.,1
Your older generation; listen; but the question about the younger folks now; the woman trying to raise the husband; and the husband trying to stay out in the street; and the children raising both of them.,0
The union ain't nothing:,1
